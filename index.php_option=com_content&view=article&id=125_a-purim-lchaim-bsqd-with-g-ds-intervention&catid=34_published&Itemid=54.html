That he woke up with <span style="font-style: italic">BS"D</span>, with the help of G-d. Every day in a normal life is replete with times that are '<span style="font-style: italic">BS"D.'</span> One doesn't even notice [them].</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"In the last seven years, since my accident, I started to pay attention to personal <span style="font-style: italic">BS"D</span> that <span style="font-style: italic">Hashem </span>gives me. I'll recount for you the most significant ones. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"The first one is that I am alive.

K. CSI (Cervical Spine Injured), quadriplegic on a respirator? Is he really saying that sitting here in this massive electric wheelchair with the constant humming, never ceasing reminder of his dependence on the non-natural life − this mechanical air-supply − is a recognition of G-d's act of intervention in his favor?!</span><span style="font-size: 9pt"> </span></span></p>  <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">I am very concerned. Having "been" with Chaim for three years, I am worried about the rebound-effect of this positive 'reframing.' Sure, it demonstrates his intense belief in Hashem, but at the close of <span style="font-style: italic">Taanit Esther</span> as the Jewish world (and this year it is <span style="font-style: italic">Purim Meshulash</span>, no Shushan Purim in Jerusalem or other cities whose "walls" predated the time of Biblical Joshua) prepares for the letting-it-all-hang-out fun of <span style="font-style: italic">our</span> victory over the descendants of the Children of Israel's arch enemy, Amalek, where will that leave Chaim? </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">If he is "fortunate" he will be in his wheelchair − not in a hospital or worse − with his respirator humming, joined by the communal heartbeat of his wonderful family. Another year in which each hour, minute, second and nano-second, remind him of who he was, who he is and who he isn't anymore. As my mind asks these questions, he is continuing to "tick off" his list of <span style="text-decoration: underline">BS"D</span>, acts of mercy that G-d's intervention permitted.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Chaim continues: "Thirdly, the ambulance was very close to the site of the accident, it took him under two minutes to arrive. The paramedic found me on the street, not breathing. He immediately began to resuscitate me. If the ambulance had been more than those two minutes away, my brain would have been damaged from lack of oxygen. This is a huge <span style="font-style: italic">BS"D</span>.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"Fourthly, even though I am paralyzed in my whole body, from my neck down; the only thing I can move besides my face is my right thumb, I can see the <span style="font-style: italic">BS"D</span> here too − the fact that having the use of both my face and my right thumb is very fortunate, because as a result, I can use that thumb to operate my computer. I use a special mouse that I rotate with my chin, which operates a keyboard, letter by letter, then I "click" another especially equipped button that works practically at a hair's-breadth of force, to "enter" the information.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"Fifthly, several times in the last seven years, I had problems with the respirator, meaning that for some reason or other it stopped breathing for me. Once I recall, a nurse wasn't in the room and the tube disconnected. Even though it beeps to alert those around, no one heard. <span style="font-style: italic">BS"D</span> my father came into the room at just that minute, and found me unconscious and saved my life before I was brain damaged, or even worse, dead.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"Sixthly, since the accident my basic contact with the outside world is by computer. As you can imagine − as this is my only form of communication with the outside world − my computers wear out pretty quickly! In the last seven years I've had four laptops, and I didn't have to pay for even one! The first one I got from my father's niece; the second one, I received from the Make-A-Wish Foundation; the third one, from Reb Chaim Miller, who was the assistant mayor of Jerusalem under (then Mayor) Ehud Olmert. The fourth computer I received less than a month ago is from a friend of my Mother's in America. I am so grateful to Yehoshua and Fraidyl for their wonderful and thoughtful gift of "connection."</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"I believe that G-d saved me for a reason. But now I am disappointed. Don't get me wrong; G-d helps me a lot in my day-to-day life. And this is the reason that I am so disappointed that my physical situation has not improved. I am G-d's friend; why am I still in this chair? I know that this decision is in His hands and we cannot use our mere minds to understand His ways. I'll give you an example: if two ants are put on the table and you try to explain the respective 2008 "platforms" of the Democratic or Republican parties, this would have the same result as our trying to understand G-d's judgment. Clearly though, I am disappointed and sad. Life is hard for me. But I believe in Hashem even in my darkest hours."</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"How do you do it?" I ask. His "<span style="font-style: italic">yahrzeit,"</span> as I call the date of the accident that changed his teenage and now adult life, is in three weeks. To say that this is a hard time of the year is to understate what is inestimable pain and mourning! To be "alive" for one's annual day of "death" sounds impossible. Yet eight years after the original 'Chaim's' catastrophic accident, he is "here," waiting for redemption. (The name <span style="font-style: italic">Chaim</span> was added to his given name, as is the <span style="font-style: italic">minhag </span>when someone is deathly ill; some say it is to "fool'" the Angel-of-Death who is seeking the person with the name given him at his <span style="font-style: italic">Brit.</span>)</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Chaim K. continues:</span><span style="font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'"> </span><span style="font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"Magic" he smiles, "seriously though, <span style="font-style: italic">Mesillat Yesharim</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Sifrei Mussar</span> and a little <span style="font-style: italic">L'Chaim</span>". He is using the <span style="font-style: italic">double entendre</span> of <span style="font-style: italic">L'Chaim</span>, which in Hebrew means "<span style="font-style: italic">to Chaim,"</span> and is what is said when you have a drink of wine or liquor.</span></span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"<span style="font-style: italic">BS"D</span>, I feel it is the mental strength with which I was fortunate enough to be born, that allows me to carry on."</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">I am in awe of his strength, "How can you teach and share with the rest of us, how we might access your strength in our own day-to-day lives with its disappointments?</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"To paraphrase the <span style="font-style: italic">Midrash,</span>" he continues, "we arrived in this world against our will or without our "permission"; we will live in this world without anyone asking if that is our choice, and we'll die too, without our opinion being asked.
