<p>Judith Guedalia, PhD and Yocheved Debow, MA</p><p><br />Abstract</p><p>The sotah (suspected adulteress) is a topic<br />of much discussion in the Torah and Talmud.<br />The basic level of the discussion is the process<br />by which a jealous husband and the kohanim<br />(priests) deal with a wife suspected of violating<br />the sanctity of marriage by infidelity. Through<br />examining the Torah and Talmud texts, we wish<br />to present an additional perspective on this<br />difficult topic. Our suggested approach reveals<br />the empathy and compassion of the A-lmighty<br />and the Torah for a woman in desperate pursuit<br />to have a child.</p>_option_option_option

<p><br />I. Introduction<br />We have always found the sotah, the suspected adulteress, a very difficult<br />topic. Although usually concise, the Torah devotes twenty verses to this problem.<br />Often, to understand the extreme concision of the Written Torah, we must look for<br />further explication in the Oral Torah. Although the Torah explains the law of sotah<br />in explicit detail, the Talmud has an entire tractate on it. Other subjects with day-to-day applicability, such as many of the details of kosher food, are afforded only a<br />few words or sentences in the written and oral law, leaving the rabbis to expound<br />on them throughout the generations. We believe that we must carefully search<br />the written and Oral Torah for a positive reason for the lengthy discussions on the sotah. We acknowledge that this problem inflicts social turmoil and terrible<br />pain on all parties involved. Yet, we must look beyond the negative aspects for a<br />positive rationale.<br />II. The Torah Text (Numbers 5: 11-31)<br />The long discussion on the sotah in the Torah seems obvious. It seems to teach<br />a negative lesson. A woman is suspected by her jealous husband of infidelity.<br />The husband takes the wife to the kohen (priest). They bring a sacrificial offering<br />of barley meal. The kohen prepares an earthen bowl of holy water with earth<br />from the Temple floor in it. The priest uncovers her hair and gives her the barley<br />meal sacrifice to hold. The kohen tells her that if she is innocent, she will not be<br />harmed. The kohen tells her that if she has defiled herself, she will be cursed by<br />the following curses:<br />The L-rd makes you a curse and an oath among your people, when the<br />L-rd makes your thigh fall away, and your belly swell. And this water that<br />causes the curse shall go into your bowels, to make your belly swell, and<br />your thigh to fall away.<br />—Numbers 5:21-22<br />The woman says, “Amen, amen.”<br />The kohen writes these curses containing the name of G-d on a parchment<br />and erases them in the bowl of water.<br />The kohen sacrifices the barley meal offering. He gives her the curse water to<br />drink.<br />If she is guilty, after she drinks the curse water, her belly swells, her thigh falls,<br />and she dies.<br />If the woman is innocent,<br />...but be clean, then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.<br />—Numbers 5:28<br />This is a summary of the plain meaning of the Torah text. Is such a complex<br />ritual necessary in order to teach us that adultery is punishable by degradation<br />and death? Taking note of the extraordinarily beneficent outcome of the ordeal<br />for the innocent woman described in verse 28, we turn to the Oral Torah to try to<br />shape a positive meaning from the sotah ordeal.<br />III. The Oral Torah (Mishnah, Talmud, and Maimonides’ Mishneh<br />Torah): The Positive Meaning Given in the Talmud<br />Although the Torah text does not seem to need more detail, when we study<br />the explication of the Oral Torah, we see that there are many questions to be<br />answered. Amazingly, we find positive meaning for the sotah ordeal in the<br />Talmud.<br />Mishnah Sotah 1:2 starts its explication of the Torah text with the case of the<br />jealous husband who forbids his wife to speak with a certain man. The Talmud tractate Sotah starts its explication of this mishnah more specifically. The Talmud<br />says that the case history of a sotah starts when before two witnesses a jealous<br />husband forbids his wife to seclude herself with a specific man. The wife flouts<br />her husband’s prohibition. She is witnessed secluding herself with the other man.<br />After this, she is forbidden to her husband. If the wife admits to infidelity, she is<br />immediately given a divorce without the fiscal rights of her ketubbah, her marriage<br />contract (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah 2:1), and the story ends here.<br />If the wife maintains that she did not have relations with the man, she is<br />branded a “sotah” (literally, “stray,” suggesting wantonness and immodesty).<br />The couple goes with the witnesses to the local rabbinical court. After the court<br />examines the witnesses, it sends the couple with two guards to the Sanhedrin in<br />Jerusalem. The seventy elders of the Sanhedrin high court try to convince the<br />sotah to confess, so as to avoid the next step in the Temple of going through the<br />degrading ordeal that leads to drinking the curse water in which the name of G-d<br />has been erased.<br />The Torah prohibits the destruction of G-d’s name. This prohibition is<br />understood to be a preventative measure. It is assumed that the woman would<br />rather admit guilt than transgress this commandment. If she comes out of the<br />ordeal of drinking the curse water unharmed, however, her innocence will be<br />proven.<br />According to Maimonides, the woman cannot be forced to go through the<br />ordeal. If she says that she is not guilty and that she will not drink the curse<br />water, she is given a divorce immediately without the fiscal rights of her ketubbah<br />(Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Sotah 2:1).<br />If the sotah withstands the pressure to confess, she is taken to the Temple. She<br />is dressed in a simple jute garment. The kohen uncovers the sotah’s hair and her<br />bosom (literally her “heart”). The point of this is to make her look “repulsive.”<br />If her hair or bosom are attractive, they remain covered (Talmud Sotah 7a and<br />Maimonides Sotah 3:11). She is publicly disgraced. The kohen makes her drink<br />the curse water. If she is guilty, her face turns green, her thighs swell and fall, her<br />belly becomes distended, and she dies (Mishnah Sotah 1:5-6 and Talmud Sotah<br />8b).1, 2<br />If the husband has ever committed a sexual offense, the curse water has no<br />effect on the suspected wife (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah Sotah 2:8). This is the<br />reason why when society later became “loose,” the Sanhedrin canceled the sotah<br />ritual (Mishnah Sotah 9:9 and Hosea 4).<br />The curse water also checks and kills the guilty male partner in the adultery<br />(Mishnah Sotah 5:1; Talmud Sotah 27a-28b; Mishneh Torah Sotah 3:17). If the<br />woman is innocent, she is not harmed by this ordeal. Maimonides says that she is<br />radiant and gains strength. She may return to her husband immediately.</p><p>Why Choose Self-Degradation?<br />If the woman is innocent, why would she choose to go through the terrible<br />ordeal of the sotah? Surely, an innocent woman who is explicitly warned in<br />front of witnesses not to be seen alone with a specific man would realize that<br />her behavior was inappropriate and will take care not to be found in the same<br />immodest position again. After having been thus warned, it would seem that an<br />innocent woman caught in the presence of the other man must have contrived<br />the apparent tryst in order to be caught. But why? What possible gain could<br />such a woman hope for that she would choose to be branded a sotah? Innocent<br />of adultery, what kind of person would choose to go through this humiliating<br />experience?<br />Sifre 19 and Tosefta Sota 5:2 interpret Numbers 5:28 (“And if the woman be not<br />defiled, but be clean, then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed”) as a promise<br />of possible reward to the woman exonerated by the sotah ritual. Shaar Ha’Gilgulim<br />says that the acquitted woman will conceive a son within a year.<br />Talmud Brakhot 31b attributes Rabbi Ishmael with the opinion that if the<br />woman had been barren, she will become fertile. Rabbi Akiva is attributed in this<br />Talmud passage with arguing that such a promise is not feasible. If this were the<br />reward, then women might purposely place themselves under suspicion in order<br />to undergo the sotah ordeal and reap the reward. Rabbi Ishmael suggests instead<br />that the reward is an incremental benefit, such as painless instead of distressful<br />childbirth, sons instead of daughters, lanky instead of stubby children, or fair<br />instead of homely children.<br />In its debate on what is the reward for the acquitted woman, Talmud Brakhot<br />31b uses Hannah’s famous prayer as the basis for concluding that an innocent<br />barren woman who undergoes the sotah ritual is promised children.<br />Hannah’s Desperate Prayer<br />The first two chapters of I Samuel describe the plight of Hannah, the beloved<br />but childless wife of Elkanah. Distraught, Hannah goes to the Tabernacle to pour<br />out her heart and pray for a child.<br />Talmud Brakhot 31b interprets the verse “Hannah spoke in her heart” (I Samuel<br />1:13) as a lament that G-d created her with organs that were never used. Talmud<br />Brakhot 31b gives a further interpretation to the verse in I Samuel 1:11, “if thou<br />will indeed look” as a threat by Hannah to G-d that if He does not answer her<br />prayer, she will force the situation by putting herself under false suspicion of<br />adultery in order to undergo the sotah ritual and be rewarded with a child by her<br />husband within a year.<br />Hannah’s threat should be understood in the context of the desperate need<br />of a barren woman to have a child. The need is so drastic that she is willing to<br />compromise herself in order to try the only option available. Her aim is to exact<br />from G-d that which she believes is the main purpose of her life.</p><p>Sarah and Tamar (Genesis 16:1-5 and 38:1-30)<br />We do not have to search far in the Bible to find other examples of personal<br />sacrifice by barren women to have children. Sarah caused herself terrible<br />humiliation by convincing her husband Abraham to take her maidservant<br />Hagar.<br />Talmud Sotah 10a and 10b retells the story of Tamar. As related in Genesis<br />chapter 38, Yehudah’s childless, twice-widowed daughter-in-law, Tamar,<br />languishes waiting for Yehudah to arrange for her the legal status necessary<br />for remarriage. In desperation, Tamar disguises herself as a roadside harlot to<br />lure Yehudah. She becomes pregnant and refuses to identify the father of the<br />fetus. (Talmud Brakhot 43b and Rashi on Genesis 38:25 praise Tamar for not<br />publicly embarrassing Yehudah.) Outraged and not knowing that he is the<br />father, Yehudah brings Tamar to trial. When Tamar provides evidence that makes<br />Yehudah understand the situation, he admits his guilt (Genesis 38:26).<br />What does Tamar have in common with the innocent childless sotah? Tamar<br />is trapped in the desperate bind of a childless widow awaiting either yibum or<br />halitsah. If she does not take action, she will be left barren and alone forever. Like<br />Hannah, she fears that the promise of her anatomy will not be fulfilled.<br />What action is available to Tamar? Like the childless innocent sotah, her only<br />choice is to violate her natural modesty. In the end, her bold decision is approved<br />by the Torah. From her children King David descended and the mashiah (messiah)<br />will come.<br />Motivation for Self-Degradation<br />What force is powerful enough to enable a woman to stand up to the terrible<br />humiliation of participating in her own dishonor? Rabbi Akiva (Yalkut Shimoni,<br />Parashat Naso, remez 709) posits that it is her desire to conceive and have children.<br />This reinforces our hypothesis.<br />Throughout the generations, the Jewish woman has been venerated by her<br />community for dedicating herself to the physical and emotional well-being<br />of her family. Both sociologically and emotionally, a woman is encouraged<br />to realize that her role in life is parenting. Rachel cries bitterly to her beloved<br />Jacob, “without children it is as if I am not alive” (Genesis 30:1). This is Rachel’s<br />subjective experience as she watches her sister and maidservant give birth to<br />Jacob’s children. This is also how Hannah felt watching Peninah produce sons<br />and daughters for Elkanah.<br />In a family-centered society, a woman feels a void if she cannot live “equally”<br />as a respected and active part of the community because she is childless.<br />Psychological Factors of Conception<br />Several observed phenomena suggest that psychological factors play a role in<br />the sensitive biological process of conception. It has been observed that couples<br />may try to have children for many years until they adopt. Then, relieved of the<br />anxiety to conceive, they conceive naturally. (Could Sarah, by orchestrating the union of Abraham with her servant Hagar that gave birth to Ishmael, have used<br />this tactic to give birth to her own son Isaac?)<br />Perhaps the powerful psychological forces unleashed by the sotah ritual<br />alter the psychological nexus and relational patterns between husband and<br />wife, allowing them to conceive. The local rabbinical court sends two guards to<br />accompany the husband and wife to prevent them having relations on the way to<br />the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem (Sotah 7a).3<br />We should not lose sight of the fact that the express purpose of the sotah ritual<br />is to bring peace between husband and wife. This is the only justification for<br />erasing G-d’s name as part of the sotah ritual (Deuteronomy Rabbah 5:15).<br />Our Alternative Approach<br />We would like to suggest an alternative approach to understanding<br />a woman’s deep-rooted desire to have a child. It seems clear that sociological<br />and psychological factors exist in all cultures. We suggest that the very biological<br />nature of woman demands that she have children. Does this biological hardwiring<br />drive a woman to try all means at her disposal to give birth to a child?<br />Hannah laments in her prayer that she was created with organs that are not being<br />put to use. G-d patterned her in a certain way, and now she challenges Him to<br />fulfill the promise of her anatomy. A woman’s body is a vessel waiting to be used<br />for its created purpose. Since biblical times until today women plead with G-d to<br />fulfill the anatomical promise.<br />It is interesting to note that medical research has discovered the importance<br />of reproduction in protecting a woman’s long-term health. According to recent<br />research, a childless woman may have a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.4<br />Similarly, research has shown that childless women often experience menopause<br />at an earlier stage of life than those who have given birth. (Previous research by<br />the same team showed that menopause is preceded by the onset of subfertility,<br />infertility, and menstrual irregularity at distinct mean time intervals of twenty,<br />ten, and six years respectively.)5 Furthermore, women who nurse their children<br />have a reduced rate of breast cancer.6 Thus, the deep-seated yearnings of women<br />from time immemorial seem to be upheld by modern medical discoveries.<br />Conclusion<br />There are biological and physiological as well as psychological needs that can<br />propel a childless woman to desperation great enough to go through the ordeal<br />of the sotah ritual. This opinion seems to be strengthened once again if we return<br />to the story of Hannah. Hannah promises that if the A-lmighty will grant her<br />a son, she will give him up to the service of G-d. Why does she so passionately<br />need to bear a child if she is ready to give him up to serve G-d? Indeed, Hannah<br />bears a son, and nurses and cares for his every need. When he is three years old,<br />she sends him to the Tabernacle with his father (perhaps because the separation<br />for her is too difficult). She was biologically hardwired to totally nurture the baby<br />from conception until he was weaned. Once the baby reached the stage that his mother’s body could no longer provide all his physical needs—and the mother’s<br />primary emotional needs had been satisfied—Hannah was able to allow her son<br />Samuel to dedicate himself to serve G-d and his people.<br />Acknowledgments<br />The main author would like to thank Rabbi Naftali Bar Ilan for his many<br />comments on the manuscript and Mrs. Bar Ilan for her help in choosing the title.<br />Rabbi Dr. Zev Gotthold was a great resource during the initial formulation of the<br />paper. Above all, no mere words can express my appreciation to my husband and<br />mentor, Rabbi Dr. Harris Guedalia for our lifetime of learning and teaching.<br />Thanks to Ms Gail Propp for reading and commenting on the manuscript.<br />Notes<br />1 Interestingly, the guilty sotah’s physical response to drinking the waters includes distended belly,<br />shakiness in the legs, and other manifestations that may be seen and experienced during the birth<br />process. This description is similar to pseudocyesis or pseudopregnancy—a psychiatric disorder<br />that may mimic many of the effects of pregnancy, including enlargement of the uterus, cessation of<br />menstruation, morning sickness, and even labor pains at term. The cause may be physical, such as<br />the growth of a tumor in the uterus, or emotional. See:<br />Int J Psychoanal 80 (Feb 1999) (Pt 1) 1-14.<br />Int J Psychoanal 80 (Apr 1999) (Pt 2) 424<br />Int J Psychoanal 80 (Dec 1999) (Pt 6) 1237-40.<br />Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, Remembering Anna O: A Century of Mystification (London: Routledge,<br />1996).<br />2 S.G. Lee studied in 1958 six hundred rural Zulus (who were uncontaminated by knowledge of<br />Freudian or Jungian theories) in Africa. Zulu society treats childless women with contempt. Lee<br />found that infertile women experienced more “baby dreams” than women with children did.<br />Pseudocyesis was common among the infertile women, and the sufferers tended to have direct<br />dreams of babies. S.G. Lee, “Social Influences in Zulu Dreaming,” Journal of Social Psychology 47<br />(1958) 265-283. See also: Fertil Contracept Sex 16, no. 6 (Jun 1988) 459-463.<br />3 Here, regarding the husband’s possible attempt to cohabit with his wife, we may hypothesize<br />another scenario. What if the husband was impotent and as such could not impregnate his wife.<br />What if the jealousy that precipitates the husband’s “warnings” to his wife and his inability to be<br />dissuaded that he is falsely accusing her are functions of his feelings that he would be “potent” if<br />he were with another woman. See M. Klein, Envy and Gratitude and Other Works (London: Hogarth<br />Press, 1975). This possibility describes in essence the psychological state of projective identification.<br />See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (Washington DC: American Psychiatric<br />Association, 1994) 756. This nomenclature describes a defense mechanism “where an individual<br />deals with emotional conflict or an internal or external stressor by falsely attributing to another his<br />or her own unacceptable feelings, impulses, or thoughts. Unlike simple projection, the individual<br />does not fully disavow what is projected. Instead, the individual remains aware of his or her<br />own affects or impulses but misattributes them as justifiable reactions to the other person. Not<br />infrequently, the individual induces the very feelings in others that were first mistakenly believed<br />to be there, making it difficult to clarify who did what to whom first.” (T. Ogden, “On Projective Identification,” Int J Psychoanal 60 (1979) 371-394.<br />Might the jealous husband, sexually separated from his wife during the process of sotah, then<br />“see” his wife through different eyes. Might he then be aroused and be able to function as<br />a “fertile” man? Could this be yet another interpretation on the sotah case when an innocent<br />childless woman undergoes a horrible experience but in the end gives birth?<br />The husband seems insanely jealous, forbidding his wife to be alone with her father and brother<br />as well. It is interesting to note that Hirschel E. Revel references that the husband even ‘warns’ his<br />wife about the shahuf—an impotent man. See Hirschel E. Revel, Otzer HaSotah (in Hebrew) (New<br />York: Shulzinger Brothers, 1941). Revel notes (in chapter 1:1, pp. 21-23) that the jealous husband<br />even fears a shahuf finding a way to manipulate his wife into becoming pregnant. We might<br />hypothesize that the husband is “overcompensating” because of his own inadequacies.<br />4 See New Scientist.com news service 25/3/02; Genetic Health, Sept 2000.<br />Later motherhood “reduces ovarian cancer risk.” The study involved 20,000 subjects and found<br />that the more children a woman has, the lower her ovarian cancer risk.<br />5 Kari Danziger, “Breast and Ovarian Cancer, Nongenetic Risk Factors,” MS, CGC (5 Sep 2000). For<br />most women, pregnancy seems to provide some protection against breast and ovarian cancer. In<br />the case of ovarian cancer, studies have shown that women who have given birth are 30 to 60<br />percent less likely to develop ovarian cancer than are women who have never been pregnant.<br />6 S.Y. Lee, M.T. Kim, M.S. Song, and S.J. Yoon, “Effect of Lifetime Lactation on Breast Cancer Risk:<br />A Korean Women’s Cohort Study,” Int J Cancer 105 (20 Jun 2003) 390-393. A study of a large Korean<br />cohort provides additional empirical evidence to current theoretical conjecture that lactation<br />decreases the risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Borrowed Tear<br />The young mother cried<br />At the brit of her firstborn.<br />I took a tear from her cheek<br />And wiped it on my own,<br />That had not yet known<br />The pain or joy of children.<br />Leah Dirnfeld </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Guedalia, J., Debow,Y.  In Desperate Pursuit of Motherhood: Another Look at the Sotah.  B’Or Ha’Torah, Jounal of Science and Judaism.  March 2005. </p><p class="tags">Tags: <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Childless&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Childless</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Sotah&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Sotah</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Suspected+Adulteress&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Suspected Adulteress</a></p></td>
