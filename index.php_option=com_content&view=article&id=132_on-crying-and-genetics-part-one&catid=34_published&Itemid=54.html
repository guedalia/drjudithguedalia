Batya (not her real name), the elder of the two children, was to be assessed. At age six, she had been held back in kindergarten for a year to help her "mature." When Mrs. L. began to explain the reason for bringing her daughter, she mentioned that she seemed to have difficulties in attention and learning and that after already repeating kindergarten, the <span style="font-style: italic">Gannenet </span>(kindergarten teacher) recommended that she undergo a developmental neuropsychological evaluation.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">

In the case of children, when the parent or parents bring the child, even without speaking, they also provide important information, which is part of the evaluation. Do both parents accompany their child? How do they relate to each other? What information about their educational and intellectual skills does their expressive language say about them?</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Mrs. L came without her husband; she gave the impression of being well educated and articulate as well as presenting as an attractive mother in her early 30s; she was also smiling uncomfortably, which isn't unusual when someone brings a child to be assessed by a neuropsychologist, but what I remember the most about this mom was that, although she was not crying at all, her eyes were swollen and red as if from crying. I had this odd association of Leah, wife of Yaacov, our forefather's wife number one.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>The Bible refers to her soft, tender, reddened eyes. <span style="font-style: italic">Rashi</span> (the noted scholar) comments that, as Lavan's oldest daughter, she cried all the time at the prospect of having to marry Esau, Rivkah's oldest son (<span style="font-style: italic">Genesis </span>29:16-17). According to the <span style="font-style: italic">Midrash,</span> she was crying because of the "inescapable" nature of the proscribed <span style="font-style: italic">shidduch</span>. At the outset, she thought she'd have no choice but to follow the societal norm, yet <span style="font-style: italic">Hashem</span> had different plans for her and she became Jacob's wife, not his twin brother Esau's (I am not relating to alternative primogeniture issues here).</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>I pushed this spontaneous association aside and continued to take the <span style="font-style: italic">anamnesis</span>, medical history.

I noticed that Batya had blotchy skin tone, her hands seemed puffy and red, her gait seemed clumsy and unsteady and, when I touched her hands, they were ice cold even though it was warm in the room.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>As her mother was speaking to me, Batya was playing with some toys, which I had put out. All of a sudden she stumbled and fell. She began to cry. Her mother went over to console her but Batya continued crying. What became obvious was that though she was crying, no tears were coming out of her eyes.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-size: 11pt"><span>       </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">I had a glimmer of an idea as to why her mother could not stop crying.</span></span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>I began to ask some specific questions. Mrs. L. looked aghast as she answered each question, one by one. "You guessed didn't you!" she exclaimed sadly. "I'm not sure," I answered, "but has she been tested by a geneticist?"</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>The mother started to cry and mumble.

We were each married to someone else and for different reasons divorced and were given this <span style="font-style: italic">shidduch</span>. We married and were so happy and thrilled when Batya was born. Then the problems began, but before we understood what was happening we had another child. Then the doctors suggested that we have tests to tell if the next baby would be okay or not. We are religious, we went to our <span style="font-style: italic">Rav</span>, and he said try again.

It is advisable for one preparing to be married, to have himself tested. It is also proper to publicize the fact, via newspapers and other media, that such a test is available. It is clear and certain that absolute secrecy must be maintained to prevent anyone from learning the result of such a test performed on another. The physician must not reveal these to anyone... these tests must be performed in private, and, consequently, it is not proper to schedule these test in large groups as, for example, in Yeshivas, schools, or other similar situations (Feinstein Moshe, <span style="font-style: italic">Responsa: Even Haezer</span> Part 4 #10, Bnei Brak, 1985.)</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Dor Yeshorim Organization in the USA and Israel does pre-marital (pre <span style="font-style: italic">shidduch</span>) screening. * </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Sadly, she went on to tell me that she felt so alone in her pain, as they hadn't told anyone in either family.
