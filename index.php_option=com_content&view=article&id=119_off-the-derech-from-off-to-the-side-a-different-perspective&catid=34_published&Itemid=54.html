The process of receiving the Torah last much longer than Moses "just" receiving it amid a "sound-and-light-show" that is the dream of Hollywood's "FX" (special effects) aficionados. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">On <span style="font-style: italic">Shavuot</span>, Moses received the Torah; He saw that the bedraggled group he brought forth under Hashem's miraculous aegis was painfully lacking in "Faith," so much so that by forming the Golden Calf they desecrated the first and second of the 10 Commandments − even before they had them in hand! Then, before all of the Children of Israel, he broke the tablets signifying "the deal is off."

Yet another group, this one is very protected by police in an ultra-orthodox neighborhood where they insist on conducting their march, carrying a "rainbow" of balloons and banners demanding that the "community" accept what the Torah considers utterly unacceptable − same sex marriages, and worse! </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">We seem to be in a conundrum of what is right-is-wrong and wrong-is-right; left-is-wrong; right-is-right; the middle-is-REALLY-wrong, as compromise is denigrated/defiled/decried and generally opposed by every position on the spectrum.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">And then, from the ridiculous to the sublime, there are the "black yarmulkes," which should just be a benign symbol of acceptance and responsibility to G-d's presence.
