<p><strong>By Dr. Judith Guedalia and Chaim K. © 2007 </strong></p><h1 style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">        "Last night I went to a good friend's wedding, yet again; my friends seem to be dropping-out of bachelorhood like flies," smiles Chaim K. aged 20, through moist eyes. "I thought about the scene of our last dance together. We were in the center of the circle, music blaring and our eyes locked. Menachem (not his real name) was holding onto my hand and spinning my wheelchair around with him. We both knew that I was happy and envious at the same time. I knew too, that he was happy that I was alive, and sad that I was locked in this chair with my respirator. </span></p> </h1>_option_option_option_option

<h1 style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>"I guess you could call this positive envy." Chaim K. has developed many theories on human behavior in the last six years since his accident. The car that hit him and left him with a severe spinal cord injury is a major factor for having time to think about how people behave. He sits in his wheelchair actively observing the world as it continues to revolve, without him, as it were. </span></p>  <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>His world today includes his warm family and "visitors" - some friends and the many more "professional" visitors: physical therapists, doctors, nursing aides, <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">rabbanim</span> from the yeshiva he attends etc. So when we sit together and Chaim talks about interpersonal relationships and human behavior, I feel that I am talking to a <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">very</span> educated layperson.</span> </p></h1><h1 style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>He continues: "There is destructive envy or jealousy. For example there is the type of guy who sees his neighbor buy a new car, say a Porsche, when <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">he</span> is driving a Honda. So a person that has <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">positive envy </span>might say: "Oh I wish I'd also have such a nice car," but the man who has <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">destructive jealousy</span> would be saying to himself: "I wish he'd crash his car into a tree and the car would be totaled." </span></p>   <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>Chaim K. has a point; there is a difference between envy and jealousy. Webster's dictionary defines <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">envy </span>as a painful or resentful awareness of an advantage enjoyed by another, joined with a desire to possess the same advantage. <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Jealousy</span> is defined as: a disposition, attitude, or feeling, and is related to "zealous vigilance."</span> </p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span><span style="font-weight: normal"> </span>Jealousy typically refers to the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that occur when a person believes that a rival is threatening a valued relationship.<span style="font-weight: normal"> </span>"I am not jealous or want the exclusivity of others' material possessions. But for the past six years I have had to try very hard not to be envious of people who walk, breathe, and move on their own.</span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Verdana"> </span></span></p>   <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Verdana"><span style="font-weight: normal">       </span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">I hope I have succeeded. I am happy for them and don't wish them ill. However, I would not be completely honest if I didn't say that seeing their freedom of movement squeezes and pulls on my heart, but I seriously don't wish them any harm."</span></span> </p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>As a psychologist, I can't refrain from noting to myself that the <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Pirkei Avot</span>, The Sayings of the Fathers, goes on to mention cupidity/desire and honor/dignity in the sentence also. A Rogerian psychologist might just say: "Umm," meaningfully. As I relate more with the Cognitive Behavioral School, I ask Chaim if he can tell me about the rest of the sentence.</span></p>   <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>He smiles knowingly, and goes on: "Without <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">ta'avah,</span> 'cupidity,' mankind could not go forward. Without our hunger/desire for food, we would starve to death. Without our emotional and physical desires there would be no future generation.</span> </p>  <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>"One of the 'positive' injunctions of The Ten Commandments requires us to honor our parents so that we may merit a long life. Five other Commandments, I guess the more 'negative' ones, tell us what <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">not to do</span>; among them is <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">not to be envious</span> of your neighbor's 'possessions.<span style="font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 2pt">'</span>"</span> </p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>Here, Chaim winks at me, as if to say: Yeah, yeah, yeah; women <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">are </span>possessions, so much for any of your "Women's' Lib" ideas. </span></p>   <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>He continues: "So how can <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">honor </span>be among the three factors that pave a man's path to death?</span> </p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>"The <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Mishnah</span> must be referring to <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">honor gone bad</span>. Not respect of others, but rather, <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Ga'avah</span>, Hubris, only requiring respect for oneself. This egocentric use of a 'Commandment' is punishable by death. </span></p>   <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>"While we see that cupidity and desire are necessary for existence, negative lust and desire are destructive to the very fabric of our society, breaking the bonds between husband and wife and the whole community makeup."</span> </p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>Here, I add that the <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Mishnah</span> in <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Sotah</span> begins with "When a man is jealous of his wife." The story of the <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Sotah</span>, the "suspected" wife, and her subsequent drinking of the "bitter waters," is indeed the basis of <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Shalom Bayit </span>and demonstrates the importance <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Hashem </span>places on honor and trust versus the "poison," jealousy can imbue in a marriage. He permits His Holy Name to be destroyed in the search for truth and <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Shalom Bayit</span>. </span></p>   <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>"Not bad," smiles Chaim, "for a woman," referring to my <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Mishnaic</span> reference.

Recently on a <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Shabbat</span> when my married sister and brother were visiting, my brother-in-law picked up my brother's daughter. This may sound complicated, but he isn't a blood relation, he's my sister's husband and the baby was my brother's child. Anyway, his own son became very jealous. He wanted his father's love, exclusively. He was crying 'Abba pick me up.'</span></p>   <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal"> </span><span style="font-weight: normal">        </span>"One of the other guests quoted this very sentence in <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Pirkei Avot</span> and explained it wisely: 'When we are babies we are jealous, when we are adolescents we have <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">ta'avah/</span>desire, when we get old we want honor and in the end we are 'removed' from the world.'"</span> </p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>As you can see, though Chaim K. may not get around freely and seems "stuck" in many ways, his mind knows no boundaries, his views of life are kinder and more "<span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Mefargain</span>" than most. He is always processing information and has insights into life from which we can all learn. </span></p>  <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>As we end our session, Chaim says: "Honor and dignity, I lost them the moment the car hit me and left me paralyzed totally, a quadriplegic; 'cupidity and desire,' I haven't ruled them out yet."
