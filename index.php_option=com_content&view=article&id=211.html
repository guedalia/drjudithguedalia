margin: 0in 0in 0pt">"But let me tell you, my readers, the real reason for my reticence in opening up lines of communication with these <span style="font-style: italic">Sherut L'Umi</span> young women.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt">"The story began six years ago - when I should have been attending high school, but because of my situation was at home.<span>  </span>The Ministry of Education assigned a <span style="font-style: italic">Bat Sherut </span>whose job it was to study and do homework with me twice a week.<span>  </span>I was 17-years-old and she was 18.<span>  </span>After a while we really connected - not just as student and volunteer, but with a stronger bond - at least on my part.<span>  </span>I had fallen in love with her.<span>  </span>During the whole year that she came to work with me I never told her how I felt.<span>  </span>When the year was over, she continued on with her life and went to study in University.<span>  </span>I began to miss her.<span>  </span>One day I spoke to her and asked that she come and visit me, just like that.<span>  </span>I told her how I felt, that I felt I was really in love with her.<span>  </span>It was so hard for me to tell her these intimate feelings.<span>  </span>I was so vulnerable and wasn't sure how she would respond.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt">"Her response was one of shock and panic.<span>  </span>She said that the feelings I had towards her were not love, but rather gratefulness for the work she had done with me.<span>    </span>'What do you want me to say,' she asked.<span>  </span>'You know what your situation is, and that there can never be something real between us,' she continued.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt">"I was very hurt by her response.<span>  </span>But I don't judge her, because I don't know how I would have behaved if the tables were turned.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt">"In the ensuing six years, I maintained a connection with her; we met occasionally and spoke on the phone.<span>   </span>The reason I kept up contact with her was that it was just too hard to completely disconnect from her. During those six years I prayed, fantasized and dreamt for a miracle - that I'd be cured and be able to 'just' walk up to her.<span>  </span>That miracle hasn't happened yet.<span>  </span>A few months ago I was in a bookstore with my father and I saw her as she came in.<span>  </span>There was a big change in her - her hair was covered.<span>  </span>She had gotten married.<span>  </span>The site hit me like lightening, and I felt as though an ice-pick had gone thru my heart.<span>  </span>My heart was shattered into a million pieces and bleeding through and through.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt">"During the six years the pain had been great, but there were also glimmers of light.<span>  </span>From the day I saw her in the bookstore, I haven't spoken with her, the contact which I thought would be impossible to break was gone; the glimmers of light that hope had allowed to seep through, dimmed to darkness.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt">"I put myself into a shell, not allowing feelings, clearly such as these, to enter or leave the protective coating of my bubble.<span>  </span>It is like a moth who loves the heat and light of the fire, but as he flies closer and closer he gets singed not warmed.<span>  </span>He can't resist the light or the heat and he moves yet closer and closer until he gets totally burned and dies.<span>  </span>But I am not a moth.<span>  </span>Once I got close to the fire the feeling was warm and the light was bright and nice.<span>  </span>But the second I got burned, I learned my lesson and now I stay away from the fire - notwithstanding the glorious feelings the light and heat bring with it.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt">"I have a job I love; I enjoy going to work once a week.<span>  </span>I don't want to get burned and I don't want to hurt anyone the way I was hurt.<span>  </span>I hope one day to be strong enough to take down the shield I put up and maybe meet another nice girl, and hope for a different ending.<span>  </span>I have learned though, from Shlomo HaMelech, who wrote in <span style="font-style: italic">Shir Hashirim</span>, Song of Songs: <span style="font-style: italic">Many waters cannot quench love, nor will rivers overflow it; If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love, It would be utterly despised." </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt"></div><p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">"In my case that means that though the fire of love stills burns deeply in my heart I will not open myself and take a chance on being derided or despised by throwing all my riches, the totality of my 'house', after love.<span>  </span>I pray and I know it will come to me, one day on its own."</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-style: italic">             Judith Guedalia, PhD is d</span><span style="font-style: italic"><span>irector or the Neuropsychology Unit; Senior Medical Psychologist; Shaare Zedek Medical Center; Licensed Psychologist; Supervisor and Specialist in Medical, Rehabilitation, and Developmental Psychology; EMDR Level II, Co-Chair Nefesh Israel.
