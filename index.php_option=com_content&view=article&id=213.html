</div><div class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">            I am reminded of stories of the ancient Greek Amazon women who were touted as active warriorettes.<span>  </span>The men and boys in their society must have paid a tremendous physical and psychological price.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Was Esther our Amazon?<span>  </span>She definitely treated and was treated by men differently; she paid a high personal price and was rewarded by Hashem in many ways. There are some sources that connect her with the building of the Second Temple.<span>  </span>Historically, <span style="font-style: italic">Megillas Esther</span> tells of events which took place just prior to the very first Feast of Purim - which may have taken place on March 7, 473 BC, 43 years after the Temple was completed(<span style="font-style: italic">Esther</span> 8:12). The Persian King she married, Achashverosh, is said to have been Xerxes I, who reigned from 485 to 465 BC. He was the son of Darius the Mede.</div><div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The Persian king who gave Nehemiah permission to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city walls in 445 BC was Artaxerxes Longimonus. (<span style="font-style: italic">Nechemiah</span> 2:1). He reigned from 465 to 424BC and was the son of Xerxes I - some say he was the son of our Esther.<span>  </span></span></div><div style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'"></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'"></span> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;

margin: 0in 0in 0pt">Thinking of that I am reminded of an "only-in-Israel" experience that took place some thirty or so years ago.<span>  </span>An ultra-religious member of Knesset was bemoaning the fact that finally there was a good television program, one that would be a positive influence on the television watching public -- he of course did not have a television at all, and never watched the show.<span>  </span>So what was he bemoaning - that the program began airing before <span style="font-style: italic">Shabbat</span> was over.<span>  </span>To what program was he referring you might ask?<span>  </span>Eishet Chayil.<span>  </span>Much to the muffled laughter in the Knesset, what this rabbinically clad member of Knesset did not know, was that this was the modern Hebrew translation of the TV show featuring the scantily, lycra-clad Wonder Woman!</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> <span>           </span>So, what's the point?<span>  </span>Queen Esther is the Persian version of every <span style="font-style: italic">yiddishe mamma </span>- fighting for her direct and more global family, following the destiny Hashem has set for her.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;

margin: 0in 0in 0pt">What about these women warriors fighting the battle of cancer?<span>  </span>They have no outward signs of or uniforms which might identify them.<span>  </span>We don't read about Haman during their "<span style="font-style: italic">megillah</span>," booing and stamping our feet.<span>  </span>The enemy is faceless and nameless, just another factor among the various challenges faced by these warriors.</div><div class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">            Hashem has given scientists the means today to fight this war again and again.<span>  </span>Whereas in previous years cancer was a disease no one spoke about, and people were seemingly embarrassed to acknowledge the suffering, today things are different.<span>  </span>Baruch Hashem, we live in a generation of ever-newer treatments; research of five or even one year ago, is dated.<span>   </span>Information is shared by cancer centers world over; the Internet connects warriors throughout the four corners of the world, allowing them to share diagnostic and treatment information, anxieties, hopes and dreams.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin: 0in 0in 0pt">What can we learn from our Queen Esther?<span>  </span>Don't see the battle as a lonely one; involve those directly around you and your community as a whole.<span>  </span>Share information - not only you but your family, and the greater community as a whole, will benefit.<span>  </span>You never know who might be living in a "walled-city," without access to the information you have.<span>  </span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;
