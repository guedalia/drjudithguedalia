<p><strong>By Dr. Judith Guedalia and Chaim K. © 2009 </strong></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>Chaim comes rolling into the office, and no sooner has he parked his motorized wheelchair he says: "<span style="font-style: italic">Hevei Dan Et Kol Adam LeKaf Zechut - </span>in the vernacular, 'give everyone the benefit of the doubt.' Look it up and see what you can find on it, I will look too."</span></p> _option_option_option

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>This year's fast day was the eighth anniversary of the cataclysmic moment when Chaim K., then a 14-year-old adolescent was walking home at midnight from his pre-<span style="font-style: italic">Pesach</span> matzah baking job, was run over by a car.  Close to four years ago, when we first started meeting, he spoke of what he knew from others about the accident (he remembered nothing).   "I had marks on my shoulders from the tires, almost all of my bones were broken - and of course, my neck, my spinal cord.  I clinically died six times, but each time they succeeded to bring me back to life- to <span style="font-style: italic">this</span> life!"</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>We discussed the results of our research on the statement he cited from the Sayings of Our Fathers (<span style="font-style: italic">Pirkei Avot</span>) in our next meetings.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p> <span>The period before and immediately after the Fast of Esther is one fraught with conflicted feelings.  Fortunately, we have a day of space between "the day the old-me died" and Purim, as we live in Jerusalem, a city that has had a wall around it since the times of Yehoshua/Joshua bin Nun.  In other words, Jerusalem is one of the world's cities (Shushan in today's Iran is another, and possibly Hebron, Haifa, Tiberias, Jaffa, Lod, Gaza, Acre, Safed and Shechem in Israel are others) where <span style="font-style: italic">Megillat Esther</span> is read on the 15th of <span style="font-style: italic">Adar</span> and not immediately after the Fast of Esther (14th of <span style="font-style: italic">Adar</span>).</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span><span>After giving me this "job" - (I understood it more as a "charge to the jury" than an "order") - Chaim told this story: </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"A year and a half before my accident, we were living in an integrated neighborhood - secular and religious; we had a neighbor, a young guy of 24 who started to become more religious and, as his family was <span style="font-style: italic">hiloni</span> (secular) we kind-of 'adopted' him into our family.  He joined us for Shabbat meals, went to <span style="font-style: italic">shul </span>with us on Shabbat and holidays, and ate in our <span style="font-style: italic">sukkah,</span> etc.  One day, that same person beat me up, not only hit me, he broke my ribs - really, he <span style="font-style: italic">actually</span> he broke two of my ribs!  He thought he had a reason to hit me, but nothing can justify such a beating of a 13-year-old kid or anyone of any age, for that matter.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"After that, I didn't report it or complain to anyone, as he was a friend of the family. He said he was sorry, and my family smoothed it over as an isolated incident and pushed it out of their memory.  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"I didn't forget.  I was very angry with him and unable to forgive him even years after it happened.  Every Yom Kippur I forgave every person in the world, but he was the only one I was unable to forgive.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"When Yom Kippur arrived after the accident in which I was run over, my brothers asked me if I forgave the person who ran me over and ruined my whole life. It was very hard but in the end, I said, 'Yes, I forgive him.'  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"I put a curse on the guy who beat me, that he never should get married or have children.   I felt that the flash of anger and uncontrolled physical aggression he showed me, should stop with him and not be allowed to be passed on to his children.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"A few years went by, I matured and became more sophisticated in my thinking.  He asked to be forgiven, yet again, and we did 'make peace.'  He told me then, that when he beat me up he was under the influence of drugs - and not the prescription type of drugs either! However, it was almost five years later when I forgave him and blessed him that he should find his <span style="font-style: italic">Basherte </span>and have a family. </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"Last night, I was at his wedding!!!  We danced, I in my wheelchair and he in his <span style="font-style: italic">hatan</span> outfit.  He has come a very long way; he is fully religious, learns in a yeshiva all day, and is truly a changed man.  I blessed him that he would have a son in this year. And he said to me that he only prays that he can come to my wedding in the near future.  It was a very emotional moment."</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>I didn't understand the connection Chaim was making until I saw the following comments on the <span style="font-style: italic">Mishnaic</span> statement: </span>Rav Nachman (of Bratislava) is quoted as saying that the <span style="font-style: italic">manifest</span> meaning is obvious: give everyone the benefit of the doubt, the <span style="font-style: italic">latent</span> meaning being: give even a guilty person the benefit of the doubt, or judge him/her in a neutral fashion.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoFooter"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>Another commentary I found on a website, (<a href="http://www.yeshiva.org.il/" target="_blank">http://www.yeshiva.org.il</a>) was that the <span style="font-style: italic">latent</span> meaning is: "Don't critically judge yourself, give <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">yourself </span>the benefit of the doubt."</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoFooter"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"What made you change your mind?" I asked. Chaim's response was:</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> "I know he is really a good guy, I am happy he got married and that his explanation that he was under the influence of drugs, and his promise that it would never happen again, forced me to see him in this positive light.  I don't think I am so powerful, that my 'curse' had the <span style="font-style: italic">effect </span>of his not finding a woman to marry, but I do think that until he was ready to admit to himself and to me that he allowed drugs into his body and the affect they had on his actions and behavior, he was not really ready to become a responsible adult and be married and have children.</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"I judged him without knowing that he wasn't fully responsible for his actions."</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>Don't you think someone who engages in legal or illegal substance abuse is at the very least responsible for taking the drugs?  What do you mean he was not responsible?</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"He was a <span style="font-style: italic">Tinok Shenishba</span> (literally, "captured infant" which is a Talmudic term used in reference to an individual who sins inadvertently as a result of having been raised without an appreciation for the rules of Judaism when s/he was able to fully understand the consequences), and this happens in any family, religious or not, Jewish and non-Jewish.  The point here being that he <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">did</span> take responsibility and rehabilitated himself fully."  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <span>Our time is up, and as Chaim K. leaves the room I feel that he too had the distance of time and experience to understand that while <span style="font-style: italic">critical thinking</span> opens the world to you, <span style="font-style: italic">critical judgment</span> poisons your mind and sours your soul.  Today maybe, he is able to judge the driver of the car on that dark night eight years ago, and almost more importantly, judge <span style="font-style: italic">himself </span>less critically.  May we all benefit in such an altruist fashion from the Sayings of Our Fathers.</span><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="tags">Tags: <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Benefit+of+Doubt&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Benefit of Doubt</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Chaim+K.&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Chaim K.</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Jewish+Press&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Jewish Press</a></p></td>
