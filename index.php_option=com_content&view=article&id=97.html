<p><strong>Testing can be comfortable and non-stressful</strong></p><p>Dr. Guedalia  believes it is important to make the testing and evaluation process as easy and stress-free as possible for both patient and parents.  She follows the patient's pace, not forcing them to follow hers.  This is helpful to patients of all ages, as people with neurological injuries fatigue easily, but is especially important for pre-school children.  Patients often comment that their fears of testing were not confirmed and that it was actually an enjoyable experience.</p>_option_option_option_option

<p>Dr. Guedalia and her staff of psychology interns, makes it a practice to educate both patients and parents so they understand exactly what is wrong and what can be done to correct it or compensate for it. The reports are written in clear, non-technical language that is easily understood by non-professionals and the psychological and physical problems . Proper evaluation can also help the physician make decisions on medication, such as which medications may be contraindicated from a functional viewpoint.</p><p><strong>What information do neuropsychological examinations provide?</strong></p><p>Neuropsychological examinations provide a broad overview of neurocognitive and emotional functioning, including sensation, perception, basic motor functions, language, attention and concentration, memory, academic achievement, global intelligence and higher integrative functions such as self-regulation, self-monitoring and impulse control.  They can shed light on the underlying causes of behavior problems, discriminating between emotional and cognitive roots.</p><p>One of the most important benefits of such examinations is to document cognitive strengths which can be used to compensate for areas of weakness.  Repeated assessment can document resolution, stabilization or deterioration of neurocognitive deficits and neurological disease.  Combined with personality testing, it can also help to differenti­ate between psychological and physical problems.</p><p align="justify"><strong>Helping both patients and parents understand the process and the results</strong></p><p align="justify">Dr.Guedalia and her staff of psychology<strong> </strong>interns, makes it a practice to educate both patients and parents so they understand exactly what is wrong and what can be done to correct it or compensate for it.
