The first two were for cataracts in both eyes, and the third was for a detached retina. He had general anesthetic and was in appropriate medical/psychiatric/psychological condition after the first two surgeries. Following the third surgery, Yossi had many deficits in cognitive and motor behavior (he was unable to walk or speak and showed poor/or no memory of family members).</span></div>   <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal">_option_option_option_option_option

My goal was to have Yossi tested by an advanced neuro-radiological test, a PET Scan. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine, medical imaging technique, which produces a three-dimensional image or map of functional processes in the body. Because of the need to inject radioactive material into patients - and in this case, a child - and it is not advisable to subject any one participant to too many scans, strict clearance is required. The test is also quite expensive, and the insurance company would have to give their approval as well. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">To make this long story shorter, there was a left hemispheric parietal finding, though a non-conclusive one. Unfortunately, neither providing the syndrome with a name, nor identifying the locale have improved Yossi's outcome, and at this point in time, his cognitive abilities have not improved. This remains the single saddest finding.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal"> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal">Originally published in the Jewish Press on August 2,2006. <br /></div> </div><p class="tags">Tags: <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Cognitive+Dysfunctio&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Cognitive Dysfunction</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=FAS&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >FAS</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Foreign+Accent+Syndr&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Foreign Accent Syndrome</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Jewish+Press&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Jewish Press</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Language+Inconsisten&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Language Inconsistencies</a></p></td>
