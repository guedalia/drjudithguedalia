The higher needs come into focus when the lower needs in the pyramid are met; Once an individual has moved upwards to the next level, needs in the lower level will no longer be prioritized. If a lower set of needs is no longer being met, the individual will temporarily re-prioritize those needs by focusing attention on the unfulfilled needs but s/he will not permanently regress to the lower level (Wikipedia). </p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">I asked Chaim K.- an eight-year veteran of a catastrophic vehicular injury that left him quadriplegic and on a respirator - what levels would be represented on his "pyramid;" "What is your triangle of importance?"</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">"What is important is the dynamics.<span>  </span>It is the same for me as for an Indian in deep darkest Amazon.<span>  </span>It is important to me as my clothes, I need to be dressed."</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">"And you always dress well," I add.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">He smiles bashfully and goes on: "The Amazon can live like in <span style="font-style: italic">Gan Eden</span>; he doesn't feel uncomfortable as he is.<span>  </span>But put him on Yaffo Street - if he can cross it without getting killed because of the construction of the 'light tram-rail,' he will be very out of place and uncomfortable.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">"That's the reason the triangle cannot be a fixed concept; rather it is dynamic and influenced by our environment."</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">But what is your triangle?</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">"Schopenhauer" - Chaim says, as I look at this "highbrow" with renewed respect - "<span>has something to say about this." </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>"Schopenhauer?"

In the absence of these elements, many people become susceptible to loneliness, social anxiety, and clinical depression. This need for belonging can often overcome the physiological and security needs, depending on the strength of the peer pressure; an anorexic, to use an over-simplification, may ignore the need to eat and the security of health possibly in a misguided search for a feeling of control and belonging.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">I see many children who are in trouble in the education system or at home, frequently their stories reflect young people who don't receive the respect of others, their teachers being on the top of this house of cards.<span>  </span>From this teetering edifice they see their parents' respect for them failing, not to speak of the respect of their peers.<span>   </span>These self-same teachers then write in referral notes that the child lacks self-esteem, self-respect, and respect for others. From which "bank" is s/he supposed to withdraw this emotional currency?</p> <p style="margin: 12pt 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">Now more than ever, as the youngest and oldest in the workforce are being let go,<span>  </span>financial houses are failing, the community on the whole needs to redefine what is considered valuable and worthy of our respect.<span>  </span>The signs of the past are going to need a new overhaul, as in all probability a 21st Century WPA - Works Progress Administration (renamed in 1939 the Work Projects Administration; WPA which was the largest New Deal agency) will take form. </p> <p style="margin: 12pt 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span>I am not judging, and I use money and enjoy its comfort as do the rest of us, but the definition of "Learning-in-Israel" for five years or so, for many <span style="font-style: italic">Al Chesbon HaBaron</span> as we say here, or on benevolence of a benefactor - may require nipping and tucking i.e. change drastically in the near future.<span>  </span></p> <p style="margin: 12pt 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">Internationally many people have lost and will lose their jobs and financial security; therein a real and present danger exists for their respective "Triangles."<span>  </span>In Staten Island, N.Y. on January 4 and 5, Nefesh International (the Networking Organization for Orthodox Mental Health Professionals) is holding its Annual Conference.<span>  </span></p> <p style="margin: 12pt 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">Our communities around the world need to be made aware and avail themselves of the wonderful work of Nefesh International and its National (Nefesh Baltimore and Nefesh Chicago) and International satellites (Nefesh England, Nefesh Brazil and Nefesh Israel) see <a href="http://www.nefesh.org/" target="_blank">www.nefesh.org</a> for a schedule of events.</p> <p style="margin: 12pt 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">Change is not a "six-letter word."
