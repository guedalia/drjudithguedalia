At age 20, he was hit by a car. Now, over five years later, after many hospitalizations and then rehabilitation, he is functioning pretty well physically. But cognitively he has some problems and serious issues with short- term memory. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">_option_option

He is well versed in three languages (Hebrew, Yiddish and English). Levi C. was referred to me about eight months ago to see if I could help develop a rehab schedule to advance him further in his recovery. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">It took a while for him to feel comfortable with me, a woman, but a <span style="font-style: italic">non-chassidish</span> one, as well! </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">When we would meet he would say that he doesn't recall anything from the last meeting.

An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life </span>(ISBN 0-399-14446-3), published in 1998. It is a motivational book by Spencer Johnson that uses parables to describe change in one's work and life.

Change occurs whether a person is ready or not, but the author affirms that it can be positive. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">His principles are to anticipate change, let go of the old, and act the way you would if you were not afraid. Listeners are still left with questions about making his/her own specific personal changes. </span></p>  <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">I looked at Levi and said, "Five years ago, you had a wonderful life.

You have a new and different life now, no question about it.
