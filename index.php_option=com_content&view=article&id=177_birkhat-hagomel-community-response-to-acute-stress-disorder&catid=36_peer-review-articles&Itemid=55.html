<p>ABSTRACT </p><p>The aim of this paper is to propose<br />the introduction of a communal ritual<br />as a post trauma early intervention<br />technique. There are specific community oriented<br />methods for dealing with trauma<br />survivors; we believe that, in particular,<br />the Jewish ritual of birkhat ha’gomel (the<br />blessing recited when saved from danger)<br />is helpful for reducing chronic effects of<br />trauma. Similar post trauma traditions are<br />seen in other ethnic groups, such as the<br />Navajo; those will be briefly discussed as<br />well. It is important to note that therapies<br />that are currently employed as the result<br />of years of research have many similarities<br />to those rituals that have existed for<br />thousands of years. When providing<br />early intervention for a trauma survivor,<br />it is important to be aware of culturally<br />appropriate treatments as well as the most<br />commonly used professional methods. A<br />combination of these techniques may be<br />effective to alleviate acute stress disorder<br />and prevent chronic post traumatic stress<br />in the general public.</p>_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option

<p>Introduction</p><p>Biblical-rabbinic and modern psychological definitions of trauma<br />overlap, both viewing a traumatic event as an experience in<br />which an individual is faced with the possibility of death or serious<br />injury. Specifically, the DSM-IV® (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of<br />Mental Disorders) defines a traumatic event as an event that is experienced<br />or witnessed which involves an actual or threatened death or serious injury<br />or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.1<br />The Talmud2 sages qualify trauma as a situation of being faced with<br />danger to one’s life. The Talmud, completed in 200 BCE, enumerates four situations after which an individual is required to say Birkhat Ha’Gomel (the<br />blessing recited when saved from danger): crossing a desert; traveling by<br />sea; recovering from illness; being released from prison.<br />Interestingly, the major criterion for performing this post trauma ritual<br />is identical to the major criterion for PTSD—a person’s perception that<br />his or her life was in danger. According to many rabbinic authorities, this<br />blessing is recited whenever one’s life was in danger, even if the circumstances<br />do not exactly match the four situations defined by the Talmud.<br />Clinical Treatment<br />Survivors of traumatic incidents (including illnesses) suffer from many<br />psychological effects. Although some people enjoy an initial phase of excitement<br />and hope as the result of having been saved from death, many<br />other survivors begin to engage in risky behavior, such as non-compliance<br />with medical treatment.3 S. Blacher4 finds the development of depression<br />and guilt in postoperative patients who seemed to feel that they were getting<br />“too good a share” in life in comparison with others who did not fare<br />as well through a disease or surgery. Holocaust survivors, paradigmatic<br />examples of trauma survivors, have been found to suffer from depression,<br />anxiety, survivor guilt, and social withdrawal.5 Other survivor symptoms<br />include fear, insecurity, anxiety, and uncertainty.6<br />Studying the guilt that results from trauma, Lewis7 believes that guilt<br />is a major outcome for most people who have experienced a severe life<br />stress. Berger8 writes that guilt is one of the four major therapy themes<br />of Holocaust survivors. People suffering from survivor guilt display<br />a prominent self-perception of unworthiness and indifference; they are<br />preoccupied with those who died. They often appear dysthymic, feeling<br />undeserving of life and believing that others died so they could live.9<br />Immediately and within the first month post trauma, some survivors<br />develop acute stress disorder (ASD), a psychiatric diagnosis which was<br />introduced into the DSM as recently as 1994. The current diagnostic criteria<br />for ASD are similar to the criteria for PTSD. ASD criteria, though, encompasses<br />a greater emphasis on dissociative symptoms, and its diagnosis can be given only within the first month after a traumatic event. Statistics<br />of prevalence vary; studies of survivors of motor vehicle accidents have<br />found rates of ASD ranging from 13 percent10 to 21 percent.11 A rate of 19<br />percent was found in survivors of violent assault.12 A recent study of victims<br />of robbery and assault found that 25 percent met criteria for ASD,13<br />while a study of victims of a mass shooting found that 33 percent met the<br />criteria.14<br />An ASD diagnosis permits early identification of trauma survivors who<br />are at risk for developing chronic post traumatic stress disorder. To prevent<br />the onset of chronic PTSD, there are many early intervention options.<br />Recently, traumatologists in Israel have presented a Position Paper<br />to hospitals and medical centers recommending that treatment for ASD<br />begin in the hospital and up to three days following a traumatic event.<br />They posit that treatment of ASD has been shown to reduce the number<br />of people who will suffer later from PTSD (personal communication, June<br />2008, Bituah Leumi/National Insurance of Israel).<br />Arieh Shalev, MD, Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and founding<br />director of the Center for Traumatic Stress at Hadassah University Hospital<br />in Jerusalem stated at a recent American College of Neuropsychopharmacology<br />(ACNP) annual meeting:<br />We found that cognitive therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy<br />worked well on these patients, whose symptoms and duration of PTSD<br />were compared at the end of three months of intervention. At that time,<br />their symptoms were significantly less severe than in patients who were<br />treated with medication, placebo, or no treatment at all.15<br />Shalev added that although antidepressants did not work during<br />this early post trauma period, it is important to continue exploration of<br />pharmacological interventions for early treatment of PTSD. Shalev says<br />that other research16 suggests that both pharmacotherapy and cognitive<br />behavioral therapy can be partially effective for PTSD when given three<br />months or more after a traumatic event. He adds that it is important for<br />PTSD survivors to know recovery is still possible even if treatment is not<br />received immediately. Nevertheless, Shalev adds that his results indicate<br />that it is best for survivors to be treated as early as possible.<br />One medical method, abreaction, is the discharge of repressed emotion by way of talking about a disturbing experience. This is often done while<br />under hypnosis, allowing the patient to discuss the traumatic event and<br />discharge the emotions that cannot be released during the normal state<br />of consciousness. Hypnotic techniques have been reported to be effective<br />for symptoms often associated with PTSD such as pain,17 anxiety,18 and<br />repetitive nightmares.19 Most of the studies which report that hypnosis<br />was useful in treating post trauma disturbances lack methodological rigor,<br />however, and therefore strong conclusions about the efficacy of hypnosis<br />to treat PTSD cannot be drawn.20<br />Another therapeutic method of coping is psychoeducation technique,21<br />recommended for the prevention and treatment of PTSD and its related<br />symptoms, including guilt.22 This technique consists of education regarding<br />the symptoms and treatments available for PTSD and any other disorders<br />presented by the patient. Blancher’s 1978 study on depression after<br />heart surgery shows one example of the effectiveness of this method.23<br />Once the depressed patients in the study were informed of the phenomenon<br />of survivor guilt, almost all of them recovered quickly.<br />Psychological debriefing (PD) has been advocated for routine use following<br />traumatic events. Its purpose is to review the impressions and<br />reactions of survivors shortly after a traumatic incident, avoiding psychiatric<br />labeling and emphasizing normalization. Recent studies show,<br />however, that while PD is generally well received by clients, there is little<br />evidence that early PD prevents later PTSD. Additionally, some studies<br />of individual PD have raised the possibility that the intense reexposure<br />involved in the PD can retraumatize some individuals without allowing<br />adequate time for habituation, resulting in negative outcomes.24<br />Eye Movement Sensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a post trauma<br />technique that has the patient imagining the trauma while making<br />back-and-forth eye movement, or alternating his or her attention to both<br />sides of the body (bilateral ‘use’ of motor cortex).25 Different variations of<br />this therapy have been found to be extremely effective with victims of<br />terror in emergency rooms.26 EMDR has been shown to be more effective<br />than psychodynamic, relaxation, or supportive therapies.27 Research com-<br />paring EMDR to cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT), however, shows<br />significantly better results with CBT at the three-month follow-up. CBT<br />results also show greater sustainability.28<br />There are many other treatments utilized for early trauma intervention.<br />Currently, EMDR during the acute aftermath of a traumatic incident has<br />shown itself to be most effective in preventing subsequent PTSD.29 Bryant<br />and others30 have conducted the only studies that specifically assessed<br />and treated ASD. They have shown that a brief cognitive behavioral treatment<br />may not only lessen the severity of ASD, but it may also prevent the<br />subsequent development of PTSD. In a 1999 study, Bryant and colleagues<br />randomly assigned individuals with ASD to five individual, ninety minute<br />sessions of either a cognitive behavioral treatment or a supportive<br />counseling control condition. The assignment was done approximately<br />ten days after an individual experienced a non-sexual assault, motor vehicle<br />accident, or work accident. They found that fewer CBT subjects met<br />criteria for PTSD post-therapy six months later. They have also studied<br />different CBT techniques (prolonged exposure plus anxiety management,<br />and prolonged exposure alone) and compared them to supportive counseling<br />intervention. The results indicated that both CBT groups showed<br />significantly greater reductions in PTSD symptom severity compared to<br />the supportive counseling group. Research comparing EMDR to cognitive-<br />behavioral treatment (CBT), however, shows significantly better<br />results with CBT at the three-month followup. CBT results also show<br />greater sustainability.<br />Thanksgiving for Salvation<br />In addition to the aforementioned early intervention techniques, we<br />would like to propose another coping method seen in multiple cultural<br />groups. In Jewish culture, this method can be traced back to biblical times,<br />when—after escaping life-threatening situations—individuals would<br />bring a thanksgiving offering to the Tabernacle and later to the Temple<br />to express thanks to G-d. The thanksgiving sacrifice consisted of a huge<br />amount of food that was to be eaten in a short amount of time. The time<br />limitation compelled the bearer of the sacrifice to share it with a large<br />group of people. In addition to taking the individual out of social isolation,<br />the thanksgiving process probably induced the survivor to talk about<br />the traumatic event many times over and as such brought about a therapeutic<br />catharsis.<br />After the Temple was destroyed, the rabbis instituted Birkhat Ha’Gomel,<br />a short prayer of thanks, to replace the thanksgiving sacrifice. The blessing,<br />which must be recited aloud in a group of at least ten, states:<br />Blessed are You, G-d our L-rd, King of the universe, Who bestows goodness<br />[even] to the guilty, Who has bestowed upon me all that is good.<br />All those present respond:<br />Amen. May G-d Who has bestowed upon you all that is good, bestow upon<br />you all that is good, forever.<br />Another version of the communal response is:<br />G-d, blessed and exalted above all blessings and praise, has bestowed on<br />you His goodly favor, love, and grace. May He in His love ever guard you<br />henceforth and grant you all that is good.31<br />Survivors often make arbitrary inferences (conclusions without any<br />solid evidence) that since they were lucky this time, they have “used up”<br />all of their merit. The phraseology of both the blessing and its reply may<br />serve to guard the survivor against such maladaptive cognitions. The<br />words imply that G-d may save us even if we are unworthy and that G-d<br />can continue to save us repeatedly (more than “just” once).<br />The public recitation of this blessing creates an opportunity for the survivor<br />to discuss his or her experiences with those present.32 It is crucial to<br />note, however, that he or she is not required to do so. This fits smoothly<br />with Foa’s guidelines for trauma response, which emphasize that the<br />therapist should listen actively and supportively but not probe for details<br />or emotional responses.33<br />Reciting Birkhat Ha’Gomel may also help the survivor recover by removing<br />excessive guilt caused by personalizing the blame for the event to<br />begin with. At first glance, it might appear that the more commonly used<br />form of the blessing psychologically ‘harms’ the survivors by labeling<br />them as guilty rather than reassuring them of their innocence. However,<br />we have discussed above the importance of facing and experiencing one’s own guilt in order to be freed from it. Once it is acknowledged, guilt can<br />be worked through in the hope of eliminating it completely. Recognizing<br />a higher authority—in this case, G-d—as responsible for the event<br />may remove feelings of blame from the survivor, bringing him or her one<br />step closer to recovery. This is similar to the popular twelve-step recovery<br />method, in which an individual feels free to heal after turning responsibility<br />over to a higher power.34<br />A similar custom is seen among members of the Navajo Nation (Native<br />Americans), who conduct a ‘Sing’ to heal tribe members who have<br />returned from combat. Sings are attended by the community at large,<br />who come in support of the traumatized individual. The Sings reflect on<br />the individual’s experience, focusing on the fact that he or she is being<br />reintegrated into society and will soon return to a normal state. Topper35<br />remarks that the Sings restore the ego function and integrate the warriors<br />back into the social setting from which they had been separated.<br />Sandner36 analyzes the process further. He finds four major reasons for<br />the efficacy of the Sing: 1. herbal remedies are often presented that have<br />psychopharmacological effects; 2. the intricate psychological structure of<br />the chants repeatedly encourages the survivor’s expectations of healing;<br />3. the survivor is socially supported by the entire community; 4. the words<br />of the chant guide the survivor to find culturally appropriate answers to<br />difficult cosmological problems, such as the management of evil. Studies<br />by Manson and colleagues37 show that Native American war veterans<br />who do not experience this type of ritualized trauma treatment have significantly<br />higher rates of PTSD.<br />The Lakota Times reported on February 22, 2006 that<br />Navajo and Hopi veterans of northern Arizona will now receive the<br />counseling services and traditional ceremonies they may need to help<br />them re-adjust to civilian life after the traumatic stress of combat or military<br />service.…the Northern Arizona Veterans Administration Health Care System<br />officially launched its expansion of services for the Navajo and Hopi<br />nations with a dedication at the Chinle Community Center.38<br />Likewise, a comparable phenomenon was found among the Betsimisaraka<br />Tribe of east Madagascar, where an influx of communal ritual<br />activity, mainly cattle sacrifices, were used to heal the community after a<br />rebellion that took place in 1947. According to the Betsimisaraka tradition,<br />if people forget their ancestors, the ancestors will punish their descendants<br />until they reconnect with them. Therefore, cattle sacrifices—a ritual<br />directed towards the ancestors and offered after war or illness—were seen<br />as a purifying ritual in which the community becomes cleansed from any<br />evil they may have done. The performance of the sacrifice, along with<br />a ritual speech containing explanatory and responsive elements, helps<br />to remove feelings of guilt or blame accompanying the traumatic event.<br />Cole’s research in the Betsimisaraka community led her to conclude that<br />rituals have the ability to aid the reconstruction and processing of painful<br />memories. Archival documents, including the Betsimisaraka testimony,<br />suggest that Betsimisaraka were active participants in the 1947 rebellion.<br />However, afterward, sacrificial speeches stated that “We didn’t mean to<br />hurt each other; it was all the government’s fault,” thus greatly reducing<br />their own guilt.39<br />Comparison of the Jewish and Navajo Approaches<br />to Proximity Immediacy Expectations<br />Both the Jewish and Navajo cultures place significant value on the necessity<br />of a supportive community ritual. There is an understanding that<br />once a traumatic event occurs, the survivor is not expected to continue as<br />if nothing has happened. Instead, there is a ritualized way of coping that<br />is very similar to the popular PIE40 early intervention for soldiers in battle<br />conditions. PIE connotes Proximity Immediacy Expectations.<br />Proximity<br />The principle of proximity—to ensure attachment to the Army unit—is<br />met by promoting attachment to a social support group. It is important<br />to note that in both Navajo and Jewish rituals, there is a quorum present<br />when the ritual is performed.<br />Immediacy<br />Immediacy is met by rules regarding the recitation of prayers. Birkhat<br />Ha’Gomel is preferably recited within three days, or, if not, within thirty<br />days, although it can be said for a significant time after that if necessary.41 It is interesting to note that PTSD is only diagnosed if the qualifying<br />symptoms for the disorder last for over thirty days. If they last for a shorter<br />time, the diagnosis is ASD. Considering that the timing of the diagnosis<br />coincides with the period in which Birkhat Ha’Gomel is recited, it is possible<br />that the blessing might help prevent the shift to the more severe and<br />lasting PTSD.<br />Among the Navajo, the ritual is performed as soon as possible, because<br />they believe that the entire community is connected. Therefore, if one individual<br />is ‘out of balance,’ all are affected.<br />Expectations<br />A clear message that the individual will return to full functioning is<br />given in the text of the blessings and chants themselves, the support<br />of the community, and the existence of the ritual aimed at normalizing<br />events. We have seen many instances in which the recitation of Birkhat<br />Ha’Gomel normalizes the experience for survivors, probably preventing<br />chronic PTSD.<br />Conclusion<br />While no formal tests have been conducted, anecdotal evidence repeatedly<br />proves that a community response is beneficial for post-trauma<br />for the reasons stated above. We highly recommend that individuals perform<br />a ceremony within a group of friends and family as soon as possible<br />after a traumatic event. As we have discussed the aspects of the Birkhat<br />Ha’Gomel prayer in particular, it is possible that a survivor can also benefit<br />from recitation of a personally meaningful prayer or text.<br />This information is particularly relevant to us as Israeli mental health<br />professionals. Since the start of the Al-Aksa Intifada in Israel, we have had<br />extensive contact in hospital emergency rooms with victims of traumatic<br />events. According to a recent study of emergency room patients in Jerusalem,<br />the ratio of physically injured to emotionally affected individuals following<br />critical incidents is 1:12.42 Reactions such as those described above<br />are almost commonplace in Israel. While a communal ritual is helpful to<br />all patients, it is especially helpful to recommend Birkhat Ha’Gomel to Jewish patients as a therapeutic early intervention.<br />Acknowledgments<br />I wish to thank E.
