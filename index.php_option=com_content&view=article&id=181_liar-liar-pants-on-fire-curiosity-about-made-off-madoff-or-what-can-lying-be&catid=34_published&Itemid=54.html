<p>I don't presume to be a criminal psychological profiler - however, the<br /> Made-off Case has piqued my curiosity. This creep (a word I usually<br /> only use for sexual predators) has stolen money from the mouths of<br /> babes, widows, orphans, and the elderly. In the Torah we learn about<br /> Leket/Gleanings; Shichicha/Forgotten produce and Peiah/Corners not<br /> collected-which seem to be the earliest forms of communal charity<br /> (Lev. 19: 9-10; Lev. 23: 22; Deut. 24: 19-22 see also Ruth 2: 2-23).<br /> </p>_option_option_option

<p><br /> Not to minimize the pain and losses which, to people who may not have<br /> everyman's pity, nonetheless may mean their homes and future viability<br /> and, more importantly, the basic trust between man and man. They can<br /> be seen as "just plain" people who trusted the creep and anyone else<br /> who was hired to "professionally" attend to the funds they "deposited"<br /> in their care. But as a student of the Brain/Behavior relationship<br /> (Neuropsychologist) and Emotion/Behavior relationship (psychologist),<br /> I wonder what is going on; I am curious. Also, under no circumstances<br /> do I present these musings as anything but - my musings.<br /> <br />  Saying that he is "just" a sociopath or psychopath seems "small". How<br /> is it that no one noticed? We notice aberrant. Maybe not immediately,<br /> but over 30-40 years! Even the Great Imposter: Ferdinand Waldo Demara<br /> was "out-ed" more than once in his career; he moved away and changed<br /> his name and "professions" as skins on a snake. This creep is the<br /> Greater Imposter!<br /> <br />  What was he thinking?!<br /> <br /> Was he even thinking?!<br /> <br />  When arrested, he said something like Lou Costello (of Abbott and<br /> Costello) used to say when he blubbered, "I'm a Baaad Boy." That<br /> doesn't do it. When kids get wise to the fact that they can exercise<br /> their annoyance on little brother/sister if "sorry" is on their lips a<br /> nano-second after they whack, we then see the need to teach them that<br /> such a thing, as "intent" and process exist. Hashem doesn't accept<br /> "sorry" without the process of Teshuvah: describing the act, admitting<br /> guilt, and getting to the same point and not repeating the act.<br /> <br /> In our terms, we teach our children that you can't hit your brother<br /> and then glibly say: "I'm sorry" as a way out. The fact that some kids<br /> figure out this tactic can be seen as a level of sophistication of<br /> thinking that needs to be "directed" more positively - immediately,<br /> and not reinforced by repeating it to one-and-all by phone, email etc.<br /> as "junior's cute cleverness." There is nothing "cute" about it!<br /> <br />  In my over 30 years in the field of psychology I have had<br /> opportunities to observe human behavior with a "psychologist's<br /> glasses." As such, I have a number of thoughts about this<br /> "Made-off-ian" behavior (unfortunately none of which will replenish<br /> the coffers of those from whom he stole).<br /> <br />  There is a (mostly unused for the past 50 years or so) psychiatric<br /> diagnosis of Lying. Pseudologia Fantastica, which was first described<br /> in the medical literature in 1891. Today it is mostly referred to when<br /> describing or diagnosing Munchausen syndrome - the psychiatric<br /> condition of lying about and portraying oneself as medically - usually<br /> physically ill.<br /> <br /> Pseudologia Fantastica is typified by the following characteristics:<br /> (1) the stories are not entirely improbable and are often built upon a<br /> matrix of truth; (2) the stories are enduring; (3) the stories are not<br /> told for personal profit per se and have a self-aggrandizing quality;<br /> and (4) they are distinct from delusions, in that the person - when<br /> confronted with facts - can acknowledge these falsehoods. In studies I<br /> reviewed when I looked into this phenomenon, discusses that the<br /> patients' IQ - Intelligence Quotient varies, but at least 40 percent<br /> have evidence of central nervous system dysfunction (that also means<br /> that that the majority - 60 percent doesn't!). Sound familiar?<br /> <br />  That said; please indulge me in continuing my "musings." What other<br /> medical/behavioral phenomenon creates a "scenario" that the person<br /> affected doesn't recognize what is clearly true? I came up with<br /> Anorexia Nervosa. The person goes through a process in which they may<br /> have begun as overweight, but clearly are in dire straits when they<br /> become mortally ill, hospitalized and/or weigh less than 80 lbs. No<br /> amount of showing them how they appear in a photograph, mirror or by<br /> comparison to another person who they feel is "thin enough" can help<br /> them see the "lie" that they are fat.<br /> <br />  A study by SW Touyz, PJ Beumont, JK Collins, M McCabe and J Jupp<br /> relates to body dysmorphia in anorexics, the perception of body shape<br /> was examined in 15 female patients with anorexia nervosa and 15<br /> age-matched controls. A lens was used which could be manipulated to<br /> cause a horizontal distortion of an image projected onto a video<br /> monitor. The patients showed a greater tendency to over- and<br /> under-estimate their present body shape than did the controls.<br /> Further, the patients' desired body shape was significantly thinner<br /> than that of controls, as was their estimation of what constitutes a<br /> normal body shape. (The British Journal of Psychiatry 144: 167-171<br /> (1984).<br /> <br />  What may be happening here? Possibly the brain biochemistry "clicks<br /> on a switch" that turns off or turns something on, which allows<br /> sensory feedback of "truth" to perceive "the other truth" or lie. Is<br /> this what may be happening to the person who exhibits Pseudologia Fantastica?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wikipedia: Pseudologia fantastica B. H. King 1 , a C. V.
