<p>By JUDITH GUEDALIA, YOCHEVED DEBOW AND DAVID DEBOW</p><p>In this paper we present an integrative model for helping perpetrators of accidental killing accept<br />the consequences of their actions and their 'new' selves. We use the model described in the Bible<br />of the 'city of refuge,' a place defined as a sanctuary to protect the 'accidental killer.' Based on an<br />understanding of the psychic trauma experienced by accidental killers, we classify their response<br />to the specific event as a form of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). We then present a model<br />for rehabilitation that could be used to facilitate the rehabilitation of accidental killers and facilitate<br />their re-entry into society.</p>_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option_option

Accidental death occurs frequently;  traffic and military accidents often claim fatalities. Such death becomes a double-edged tragedy, for both the bereaved family and the accidental perpetrator, whose experience often sentences him/her to a lifetime of turmoil. The Bible discusses the concept of a “City of Refuge” (Hebrew: Ir Miklat), a sanctuary to protect the accidental killer, who was to move to one of these forty-eight cities and live there for an indeterminate period of time (Exodus 21:12-14; Numbers 35:9-29; Deuteronomy 4:42; 19:1-13) We suggest that an analysis of the guidelines and directives clearly stated in the Bible and Rabbinical commentaries may not only provide insight into the psychological trauma experienced by an accidental killer but also help provide ideas for a contemporary rehabilitation model. We have selected concepts from studies of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and have also used the     diagnostic framework of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Moreover, we examine the Ir Miklat (IM) from a psychological perspective. It is our contention that the IM concept can serve as a model for understanding the effects of accidental death on the accidental killer (or, in the words of the Bible, `Rotzeah Beshegaga’, hereafter RB), his/her family and the surrounding society. </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">Purpose</span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Accidental death is a frightening prospect, as it may occur to anyone. Most people would like to believe in the orderliness of events in this world, yet accidental deaths occur under many different circumstances. Recently, the secrecy surrounding incidents of accidental killing in the Israeli Defense Forces has been lifted. Live ammunition is used regularly in training exercises, and the dangers of accidental killing in the army are felt more acutely than in everyday life. Nevertheless, newspapers are filled  with reports of fatal traffic accidents, which are the major locus of accidental killing. From 1982 to 1992 in Israel alone there were 4879 people killed in traffic accidents.<a name="_ednref1" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[i]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> An extensive search for empirical data,  including a computer search of the psychological literature since 1987, revealed only twenty-four papers mentioning accidental  killing. Of these, not one dealt directly with the impact of accidental killing on the person who caused it. It thus emerges that despite the large number of people facing this tragedy and the ensuing distress, attempts at helping the perpetrators of accidental killing face their own future are insufficient.<span>  </span>In searching for a model, we examined the IM concept presented in the Bible </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">Ir Miklat </span></strong></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">The Ir Miklat (IM), or City of Refuge, is a Biblical concept  described in several Biblical texts (Exodus 21:12-14; Numbers 35:9-29; Deuteronomy 4:42; 19:1-13) as a city to which an accidental killer could flee to escape the vengeance of the victim’s family. The plan as described in the Bible calls for six such cities to be set up, specifically dedicated to being Cities of Refuge (Numbers 35:6). Another forty-two cities, which were set aside for the Levites to live in, were also available to be used as Cities of Refuge<a name="_ednref2" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[ii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> for Israelites who had committed an accidental killing. Immediately after the accident, before a court had decided whether the death indeed conformed with the legal definition of “accidental killing,”  the perpetrator would flee to an IM and would be protected within the clearly marked boundaries of this `sanctuary’. S/he would thus no longer be vulnerable to `blood avengers’, family members of the deceased who would not be tried for murder if they took the life of the accidental killer outside an IM (Numbers 35:27).  Rabbinical sources and biblical commentators, who continually re-evaluate and re-interpret the biblical sources, have endeavored to find a precise legal definition of accidental killing. It is distinguished from criminal negligence on the one hand and total circumstantial involvement on the other. In this paper we are discussing the `inadvertent’ homicide—homicide in which there is a slight degree of negligence.<span>  </span>Once a person was adjudicated an accidental killer, s/he was permitted to live in the IM and continue his/her normal existence there. The exact time of release was arbitrary, as it depended on the death of one of the three High Priests who functioned at any given time. Only then was the accidental killer permitted to leave the IM and return to his/her previous home (Exodus 35:25. It is this concept of Ir Miklat that we wish to explore.<br /> <br /> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">The Accidental Killer -- `Rotzeach Bishgaga’</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br /> In any fatal accident, the focus is usually on the deceased and    his/her relatives. However, there is often someone who feels responsible for having caused the death, however unintentionally.<a name="_ednref3" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[iii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> <span>  </span>There are many and varied types of situations in both army and civilian life which can lead to accidental killing. A search of papers published in psychological journals since 1987 reveals almost no literature dealing with the problem of the accidental killer. One book, Fatal Moments<a name="_ednref4" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[iv]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>, is based on interviews conducted from 1980 to 1990 with nearly 200 people who responded to their call to explore this phenomenon. The study presents the following model of the experience of the accidental killer, claiming that, despite some individual variation, most<br /> accidental killers experience a similar pattern of responses. Generally,<br /> psychological shock comes first. During this brief period of numbness, the<br /> mind hides from the full realization that one has caused the death of<br /> another human being. This is followed by preoccupation with the accident. In the<br /> struggle to make sense of the event, many accidental killers replay it over<br /> and over in their minds. Anger often engulfs the accidental killer, directed<br /> at every aspect and player in the accident, including the victim. Guilt is<br /> nearly universal, causing accidental killers to torture themselves for<br /> unfounded reasons as well as for error and oversight. Depression, also<br /> common, may occur in various forms. Their internal turmoil may cause them to<br /> withdraw from family and friends and keep them from normal social<br /> interaction. They usually experience some form of social tension, often<br /> resulting from the failure of their friends and associates to respond or act<br /> supportively, due to their unfamiliarity with the situation. Family stress<br /> occurs as well.<span>  </span>At some point, virtually all accidental killers begin the process of<br /> healing. Nevertheless, the aftermath of the event extends throughout their<br /> lives<a name="_ednref5" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[v]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>. Thus most accidental killers themselves become victims of the event.  All the symptoms experienced by accidental killers are included in the definition of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br /> DSM-IV<a name="_ednref6" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[vi]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>  lists several diagnostic criteria for PTSD:<br /> A.

The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or  impairment in<br /> social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.<br /> There are so many stimuli that can engender an emotional reaction that it is<br /> hard to avoid the cues that evoke the memory of the trauma .<a name="_ednref7" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[vii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a><span>  </span>A study of police officers who had witnessed or taken part in shooting incidents found that many suffered from<br /> a reaction that took the form of severe PTSD symptoms.<a name="_ednref8" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[viii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> It<br /> would indeed seem that these people have experienced a psychologically<br /> distressing event and that their reactions often fit the DSM-IV criteria of<br /> PTSD listed above.<br /> Although recent research indicates that all these symptoms are usually<br /> experienced at the same time, it is still interesting to note the<br /> similarities with the classic model of the stages of mourning described in<br /> Kubler-Ross’s seminal work<a name="_ednref9" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[ix]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>. There is a difference only in the final<br /> stage: `aftermath’ in accidental killing and `acceptance of death’ in the<br /> Kubler-Ross model. We propose that what may make it difficult for RBs to<br /> experience `acceptance’ in any way may be that they actually remain in   the<br /> state of mourning. They are mourning not only for the victim who actually<br /> died but also for themselves, who are still alive, but no longer in their<br /> former state of innocence—the person they were before the fatal moment. At<br /> some point RBs apparently realize that they can never be this old self<br /> again; the moment of accidental killing has irrevocably changed them and in<br /> a certain way perhaps “deadened” an innocent and unburdened self. Thus they<br /> may actually be mourning for the person they can no longer be. Shalev<a name="_ednref10" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[x]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a><br /> offers a psychodynamic formulation of PTSD as  “incomplete processing of<br /> traumatic experiences similar to pathological mourning”. Although he<br /> considers this definition insufficient to encompass the full nature of<br /> PTSD, it could certainly serve as a partial explanation of the psychic<br /> processes occurring in the PTSD patient, particularly the RB.  <br /> Accidental killers are frequently acquitted in court for the crime of<br /> manslaughter. Legal exoneration, however, cannot reverse the accident and<br /> return the dead person to life, nor can it render the RB a person who has<br /> not killed anyone, albeit accidentally.  Often, an RB’s reaction after being<br /> acquitted is to say that the person is still dead, and “it was still my<br /> finger on the trigger”  <a name="_ednref11" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xi]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>. Although the law has judged them to be not guilty, their own acute awareness of loss prevents them from accepting that judgment. The RB is no longer the same person s/he was before the event and must spend time mourning the loss of his/her former, “untainted” self.   The importance of allowing accidental killers to<br /> experience these feelings of guilt has recently been recognized. Terr,<a name="_ednref12" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a><br />   in her book on psychic trauma in childhood, emphasizes the<br /> importance of guilt as an adaptive mechanism. It allows trauma victims to<br /> feel that they had a certain amount of control, even in a situation in which<br /> their control was actually minimal. The event can then be faced and worked<br /> through. Where there is no working through of the guilt, shame frequently<br /> becomes the predominant emotion. It is usually compounded by feelings of<br /> helplessness, which make it more difficult for victims to forgive<br /> themselves and move on to redefinition and acceptance of the self<a name="_ednref13" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xiii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a><br /> <br /> <br /> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">Ir Miklat—An Understanding Based on the Biblical Text and Commentaries</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br /> The Biblical injunction ordering RB’s to proceed to an IM contains highly specific directives: All homicides, whether inadvertent or not, fled to an IM and were then brought back to their own town for trial. An RB had to<br /> immediately leave the environment in which s/he was living and go to the<br /> nearest City of Refuge. Inherent in the command is the immediacy and<br /> specificity of the directive. It is imperative to gather oneself together<br /> and proceed actively. At every intersection there were signs pointing to the<br /> nearest IM, so that it was always accessible.      The IM was<br /> inhabited by members of the Tribe of Levi and accidental killers.<br /> Traditionally, the Levites had no land of their own, thereby freeing them<br /> from agricultural responsibilities.  Instead, they were the teachers and the<br /> social workers, the caretakers of the nation. Their life was dedicated to<br /> the soul and spirit of the people, and it would seem that part of their<br /> responsibility was to live in the Cities of Refuge, perhaps as the  “support<br /> staff” for those RBs who needed moral support during healing<a name="_ednref14" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xiv]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>.   It is explained that the city must be neither too large nor too small  <a name="_ednref15" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xv]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>. This ensured a<br /> sense of community,  while guaranteeing the RB privacy as well. Another<br /> important structural feature was that RBs were never to be a majority of the<br /> population <a name="_ednref16" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xvi]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>.

The number of people suffering </span></p>  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">from trauma was never so large that the support mechanism could not function</span></p>  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><span> </span>efficiently. The city always had a group of empathic people who were not caught up in working the land, but were free to be helpful and supportive as necessary.<br /> <br /> Once an RB was sentenced to spend time in an IM, he would not go there<br /> alone; he was encouraged to move there with his family and a “Rabbi” or<br /> mentor. (Here we must use the masculine form, as apparently the rule that<br /> the RB’s family and mentor must accompany him to the IM applied only to<br /> males. The husbands of female RB’s were enjoined to continue supporting<br /> them, but they were not required to accompany them to the IM. Thus women in<br /> this position were given some support, but not as much as men; it is the<br /> model as proposed for males that we suggest for emulation.) The RB was to be<br /> separated from his previous life, but only partially. Perhaps  “relocation”<br /> would be a more appropriate term. Clearly, the resettlement of the teacher<br /> and family would be difficult, yet it was essential for maintaining the RB’s<br /> existence. The importance of taking along parts of one’s former life<br /> to the IM was understood. Perhaps another purpose was to make sure the RB<br /> would not be able to cloak himself in secrecy. On his arrival in an IM he<br /> was announced as an RB.<a name="_ednref17" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xvii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> This publicity was not a public branding of shame, </span></p>  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">but rather meant for the purpose of integration.

The IM thus addresses the<br /> unavoidable change in self-concept following trauma, a notion that is often<br /> a basis for modern-day dynamic psychotherapies for PTSD. Thus, although RBs<br /> were running<span>  </span>‘away’ from ?the scene of the trauma, they were also<br /> running ’towards’ a place that would redefine them specifically through<br /> this trauma, and force them to face the consequences of their acts, albeit<br /> within a therapeutic and supportive setting.<br /> This combination of running away from the scene of the crime,  while<br /> running towards a place where help could obtained, creates an apparently<br /> paradoxical combination of avoidance and activity.  Activity seems important<br /> for giving one a feeling of control over one’s body, something RBs may feel<br /> they have lost by doing something which seems to have been uncontrolled<a name="_ednref24" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxiv]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a><br /> . In her book describing her work with the Chowchilla children,<br /> Terr shows that those who were able to actively do something to try and save<br /> themselves from the disaster emerged less traumatized,  apparently because<br /> they had been active in protecting themselves.  She notes in particular that<br /> one child, who was explicitly told not to help because he was “too weak and<br /> too fat”, spent years trying to prepare himself for the next time he could<br /> be a “hero” until he died at the age of fifteen in an accident.<a name="_ednref25" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxv]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a></span></p>  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Although this is only a single case, it nevertheless supports the contention<br /> that being active provides a certain sense of control that facilitates<br /> recovery. Activity can also help alleviate the psychological numbing defined<br /> as a common symptom of PTSD in DSM-IV (1994). Flooding therapies can<br /> exacerbate symptoms by evoking emotions associated with the trauma. However,<br /> seemingly unrelated activities can work as occupation therapy to provide<br /> inputs that give rise to unassociated feelings. Thus allowing the person to<br /> have safe emotional experiences that do not have to be suppressed through<br /> numbing.<br /> <br /> An added function of the signposts placed all over the country, directing<br /> people to the IM, might be to desensitize the population in general to the<br /> idea of accidental killer and thus facilitate their acceptance within the<br /> community.  They became a part of people’s awareness and thus may have<br /> served to minimize the accidental killer’s sense of being a `pariah’. In<br /> describing the City of Refuge, the Midrash, a homiletic commentary on the<br /> Bible, calls it “a healing for you”<a name="_ednref26" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxvi]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>. This  seems to imply an understanding that </span></p>  <p style="margin-left: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">accidental killers indeed need a place to escape to for the purpose of introspection, </span></p>  <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">far from the normal routine of life, which should help them confront the enormity of the events. The Bible displays sensitivity to the RB’s  traumatic experience, realizing that under such circumstances people cannot be expected to return to their usual<br /> lifestyle without taking time out to work through the trauma.<br /> Moreover, being accompanied to the IM by one’s mentor and family changed the<br /> nature of the exile. Perhaps its purpose was to demonstrate that one’s<br /> lifestyle should not be altered. There is clear evidence of the importance<br /> of family support in facilitating the recovery of trauma victims despite the<br /> fact that they cannot always provide all the support a trauma victim needs<a name="_ednref27" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxvii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>,<a name="_ednref28" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxviii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a><br /> <br /> Another purpose may have been to prevent a reaction that is fairly common in<br /> PTSD—the feeling that the future is foreshortened that there<br /> is nothing more to live for, that one’s life is basically over.<a name="_ednref29" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxix]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> Thus the RB<br /> was not allowed to be cut off from his immediate supportive environment,<br /> even though he was forced to move away from a society which might well have<br /> difficulty taking him back.

It was for this reason that the</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">RB’s arrival at the IM was announced in advance. The environment did not</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">permit avoidance.  This addressed a major symptom of PTSD.<br /> As mentioned previously, RBs generally experiences guilt feelings despite<br /> legal acquittal. By bringing them to an environment in which they would be<br /> with others in a similar situation, the IM directive eased their<br /> bewilderment and provided a sense of comfort and fraternity. Family or<br /> friends who never had this sort of experience may be unwilling to listen to<br /> repeated descriptions of the horrors of the event <a name="_ednref31" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxxi]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>.<br /> Sharing experiences with others in similar circumstances can help the RBs in<br /> many ways. It encourages them to confront the fact that they do indeed<br /> have a new identity, similar to that of others in the new environment. This<br /> confrontation, which may occur in the face of denial, often serves to<br /> relieve some of their anxiety by demonstrating that there are other people<br /> in the same predicament. This, in turn, may help alleviate guilt feelings.<br /> Living in a place with others who may be more advanced in the healing<br /> process, can encourage them to face the future. Although separated from<br /> their previous way of life and aware that guilt feelings cannot be ignored,<br /> the RBs are not alone in their experience and reactions to it. Clearly,<br /> sharing these feelings with others and being exposed to others in various<br /> stages of recovery from their trauma can facilitate rehabilitation.<br /> There are a various reports in the literature about the use of group and<br /> milieu therapy for the treatment of PTSD, particularly with Vietnam veterans<br /> <a name="_ednref32" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxxii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>,<a name="_ednref33" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxxiii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>. The first of these reports describes a  week-long program for a group of Vietnam veterans<br /> at Camp David, an area surrounded by mountains and isolated from nearby<br /> towns. The treatment program included traditional treatment methods for<br /> PTSD, as well as Native American healing techniques. An evaluation<br /> immediately after the program, and a three-month follow-up, indicated<br /> significant a reduction of symptomatology for nearly every measure of<br /> psychopathology. <a name="_ednref34" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxxiv]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a><br /> <br /> Another helpful factor is that the IM was primarily inhabited by Levites—an<br /> important sector of the community, mentors of the population. Thus the RBs’<br /> knowledge that they were not being sent to spend their `sentence’ with a<br /> socially undesirable community, but were worthy of the company of the<br /> Levites, may also have served to help them re-acquire a favorable sense of<br /> identity. It is interesting to note that the Levite community also served a<br /> primary role in preparing the sacrifices for the Temple. They were known to<br /> be people characterized by great precision.<a name="_ednref35" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxxv]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>  It might also<br /> have been important for accidental killers to be exposed to this trait as<br /> part of their battle against the randomness of the event that had so<br /> dramatically changed them.<br /> Finally, there is the arbitrary release time. This awareness of non-control<br /> is essential in mitigating the RBs’ sense of personal responsibility for<br /> themselves and the community, and in facilitating rehabilitation and a<br /> return to the larger society.<br /> <br /> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial">Discussion</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br /> Modern society appears to respond to killing dichotomously—either it is<br /> accidental and therefore not punishable, or it is intentional and therefore<br /> punishable. Ancient Jewish society added a middle possibility—even if the<br /> killing may be accidental, so that the killer is innocent of a crime, s/he<br /> is nonetheless responsible for a death, and must therefore be punished. The biblical injunction ordering RBs to proceed to an IM has traditionally been understood as serving as a punishment for the R.B. and a necessary step in facilitating Kapparah for causing, even accidentally, the death of another human..<span>  </span>Today, accidental killers are aware that they have caused someone’s death, yet there is no formal reaction from society. The implicit message is that the RBs are not at fault and may therefore disassociate themselves from the tragedy. This situation makes the natural process of mourning and subsequent rehabilitation into society more difficult. It leaves the RBs without the<br /> means to integrate this traumatic event into a new personal identity, and<br /> thus leads to behaviors that are defined as PTSD symptoms.<br /> The palpable result is heightened PTSD. A powerful symptom of PTSD, which<br /> exacerbates the RB’s suffering, is avoidance <a name="_ednref36" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxxvi]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>. Healing<br /> is a long, slow process that comes with introspection and facing the reality<br /> of what has happened.<a name="_ednref37" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">[xxxvii]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> The concept of IM provides many lessons. <br /> society needs to separate from the RB, and that the RB needs to be<br /> distanced from the physical cues of the environment in which the accidental<br /> killing occurred. This relocation permits the RBs to mourn for their old,<br /> <em>unconfounded</em> self, and construct a new, acceptable personal identity. Being<br /> in a supportive and accepting societal environment in which RBs are<br /> recognized as such—in this  new and as yet <em>unintegrated</em> identity—could<br /> facilitate their rehabilitation. As the modern outlook appears to recognize<br /> formally only one dimension of the situation—guilty as opposed to innocent<br /> of a crime—there is no place for the paradoxical psychological needs of the<br /> accidental killer. Establishing a middle ground—innocent and yet<br /> responsible—accepts the reality that this person’s two losses (of the person<br /> who was killed as well as his/her own previous `innocent’ self) must be<br /> accounted for. This allows RBs to redefine themselves in a way that is<br /> congruent with his/her psychological state.<br /> <br /> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial">Conclusion</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial"><br /> The treatment of PTSD remains a challenge for the health profession.  The<br /> complexity of the disorder underscores the difficulty in establishing a<br /> clear treatment of choice, or perhaps a constellation of treatments of<br /> choice, for patients suffering from PTSD. Moreover the paucity of literature<br /> on the subject of accidental killers reflects the lack of attention given them as a<br /> group. Perhaps it is easier for those in the helping professions to comfort<br /> and work with “ pure victims” rather than “victim-perpetrators”.  They are,<br /> however, undoubtedly people who have undergone a traumatic event, and as<br /> such deserve our attention.<br /> In this paper we have attempted to present the Biblical model of the Ir<br /> Miklat as an all-encompassing approach to the treatment of the specific<br /> trauma of accidental killers.<br /> Nevertheless, the model as it existed in ancient times clearly cannot be<br /> transferred as a whole to modern-day society. It must be kept in mind that<br /> an important element in the efficacy of the IM model, which would be<br /> difficult to replicate nowadays, is the idea of ritual integral to the<br /> procedure. The clearly set out rules and processes were an accepted form<br /> enabling RBs to expiate their sense of guilt. At present, when these<br /> practices are not accepted by the larger society, there is no prescribed way<br /> for RBs to act.  However, the model of a separate community can certainly be<br /> operationalized today in the form of group homes or special facilities.  The<br /> experimental model for treatment of Vietnam veterans at Camp David was very<br /> similar to the IM model. There are other models for rehabilitation of drug<br /> abusers—for example, the Gateway Drug Rehabilitation Clinic in<br /> Pittsburgh—which could perhaps serve as a model for creating a<br /> rehabilitative environment for RBs. There may even be existing facilities<br /> which could be redefined in line with the IM model. The Israel Defense Force<br /> presently has a facility that seems to have a similar aim. It could<br /> certainly serve as a basis from which to launch a more encompassing model<br /> that would take into consideration the various symptoms experienced in<br /> PTSD.<span>  </span>Although the Levite Tribe no longer serves the functions it had in<br /> ancient times, the psychologists and social workers of today could serve<br /> similar functions, at least as a therapeutic staff, if not as a community in<br /> which RBs could live.  The fact that Biblical practice foreshadows many of<br /> the same techniques currently used in modern-day psychotherapies for the<br /> treatment of PTSD seems to invite using the wisdom of long ago for those<br /> who still suffer today as accidental killers.<br /> <!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br /> <!--[endif]--></span>  <div><!--[if !supportEndnotes]--><br />  <hr width="33%" size="1" />  <!--[endif]-->  <div id="edn1">  <p class="MsoEndnoteText"><a name="_edn1" href="index.php_option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=178.html"></a>References:</p>  <p class="MsoEndnoteText"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">[i]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span> <span style="font-family: Arial">Ministry of Transportation: Road Safety Authority (1993).
