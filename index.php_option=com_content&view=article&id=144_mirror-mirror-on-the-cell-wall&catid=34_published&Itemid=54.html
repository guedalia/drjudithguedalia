In this area of brain-behavior research, scientists are studying the emergent area of "<span style="font-style: italic">Mirror Neurons</span>," or to use Sandra Blakeslee's article titled, "Cells That Read Minds" (see The New York Times, Jan. 10, 2006</span><a name="articleBodyLink" title="articleBodyLink"></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">).</span></span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>This discovery happened like many others - accidentally. But the persons seeing the "behavior" were neuroscientists, who were prescient enough to understand that what they were observing was a key to understanding human behavior. Examples: empathy, philosophy, language, imitation, autism and even psychotherapy. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>One summer day 15 years ago in Parma, Italy, a monkey sat in a special laboratory chair waiting for researchers to return from lunch. Thin wires had been implanted in the region of its brain involved in planning and carrying out movements.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><a name="secondParagraph" title="secondParagraph"></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>A graduate student entered the lab with an ice cream cone in his hand. The monkey stared at him. Then, something amazing happened. When the student raised the cone to his lips, the monitor sounded; and even though the monkey had not moved but had simply observed the student grasping the cone and moving it to his mouth, the area of its brain responsible for these actions "mirrored" them, as if the monkey himself had an ice cream cone in its hand.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Iaccomo Rizzolati and Vittorio Gallasse discovered mirror neurons. They found that neurons in the ventral pre-motor area of macaque monkeys will fire any time a monkey performs a complex action, such as reaching for a peanut, pulling a lever, pushing a door, etc. (Different neurons fire for different actions.) Most of these neurons control motor skill (originally discovered by Vernon Mountcastle in the '60's), but a subset of them, the Italians found, will fire even when the monkey watches another monkey perform the same action. In essence, the neuron is part of a network that allows you to see the world "from the other person's point of view." Hence the name, "mirror neuron." </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"It took us several years to believe what we were seeing," Dr. Rizzolati said in a recent interview. The monkey brain contains a special class of cells, called mirror neurons, that fire when the animal sees or hears an action, and when the animal carries out the same action on its own. But if the findings, published in 1996, surprised most scientists, recent research has left them flabbergasted. Humans, it turns out, have mirror neurons that are far smarter.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>He continued, "Mirror neurons allow us to grasp the minds of others, not through conceptual reasoning but through direct simulation. By feeling, not by thinking." </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="color: black"><span>         </span>Everyday experiences are also being viewed in a new light.

"Intriguingly, in 2000, Eric Altschuller, Jamie Pineda and I were able to show (using EEG recordings) that autistic children <span style="font-style: italic">lack</span> the mirror neuron system. And we pointed out that this deficit may help explain the very symptoms that are unique to autism: lack of empathy, theory of other minds, language skills, and imitation." Although initially contested, several groups - including UCLA, spearheaded in part by Lindsey Oberman in Ramachandran's lab - have now confirmed this discovery of the neural basis of autism.</span></span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Mirror neurons also deal a deathblow to the "nature vs. nurture" debate, for it shows how human nature depends crucially on <span style="font-style: italic">learnability</span> that is partly facilitated by these very circuits.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span style="color: black"><span>         </span>Ramachandran</span>'s pronouncement that "mirror neurons will do for psychology what DNA did for biology," is a prophesy which is already starting to come true.
