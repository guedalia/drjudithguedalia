This is a film that evokes in the audience, an almost visceral experience of the idealism, fear, boredom, ardor, frustration, honor, bravery and zeal of </span><span style="font-style: italic">Eretz Israel's</span><span> young men.

Everyone was speaking about the war -Operation Shalom Hagalil - that has become known as The First War in Lebanon. It began with the constant shelling of Kiryat Shimona and consequent entry into Lebanon by Israel in June of 1982.
