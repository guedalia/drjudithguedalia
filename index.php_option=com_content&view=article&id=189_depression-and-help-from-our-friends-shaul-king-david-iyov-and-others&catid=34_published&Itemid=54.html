His favorite food is thistles. Eeyore doesn't expect much of himself and remains quiet for most of the time.  Eeyore has few expectations from his friends and always expects the worst whenever they come to help him.<span>  </span>Here is where his friends come in handy; they dismiss his gloomy thoughts, which cause him to feel grateful to them.<span> </span>Eeyore's biggest problem is his tail falling off, which happens frequently.<span> </span>Looking for it and then reattaching it is where his friends help him the most.  </div> <div class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> <span>           </span>Iyov is the quintessential icon for loss.
