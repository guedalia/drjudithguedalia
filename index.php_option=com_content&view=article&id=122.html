When I answered in the affirmative the woman on the other end of the phone began to cry. I just held on to the phone. "Are you still there?" she gasped, "yes, I'd sing Muzak (elevator music) if I knew how, but as things stand now you would cry harder." That elicited a little auditory smile. "In what way do you think I can help you", I asked. "I don't really want to say, but the good cry I had with someone on the other end was enough. Thank you so much for being there," she said and hung up.</span></font></p> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">_option_option_option_option_option

Often when people talk to each other, they don't listen attentively. They are often distracted, half listening, half thinking about something else. When people are engaged in a conflict, they are often busy formulating a response to what is being said. They assume that they have heard what their opponent is saying many times before, so rather than paying attention; they focus on how they can respond to win the argument.</span></font></p></div>  <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"Active listening is a structured form of listening and responding that focuses the attention on the speaker. The listener must take care to attend to the speaker fully, and then repeats, in the listener's own words, what he or she thinks the speaker has said. The listener does not have to agree with the speaker - he or she must simply state what they think the speaker said. This enables the speaker to find out whether the listener really understood. If the listener did not, the speaker can explain some more.</span></font> </p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"Active listening has several benefits. First, it forces people to listen attentively to others. Second, it avoids misunderstandings, as people have to confirm that they do really understand what another person has said. Third, it tends to open people up, to get them to say more."</span></font></p></div>  <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">When years ago a doctor (I won't use her name as I didn't 't reach her to ask her permission, but she is well known in her community) noticed bruises on women too scared to cry or complain, she began what was then an uphill-battle of giving a voice to those who had none. Rabbi Abraham J. Twerski, M.D. went on to write a book about spousal abuse in the <span style="font-style: italic">frum</span> community (<span style="font-style: italic">The Shame Borne in Silence: Spousal Abuse In The Jewish Community</span>, 1996, Mirkov Publications, Inc Pittsburgh, PENN) which was subsequently banned as being too provocative and a source of <span style="font-style: italic">Hilul Hashem</span>!</span></font> </p></div>  <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Some people felt that if you don't mention it, it won't proliferate; just the opposite has been proven true. By allowing the abused a voice and an ear, the <span style="font-style: italic">frum</span> world is taking its rightful place as the moral compass of our society.</span></font></p></div>  <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Between those two "pioneers" and many other courageous souls like them who understood spousal abuse for the damage that it does, be it physical, verbal or emotional, this horrific crime - which can even exist in the frum community - has been brought to public attention. </span></font></p> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Now Beth Israel Medical Center, New York City, has received a grant to reach out to various culturally unique communities to help identify and treat those who are suffering in silence.</span></font></p></div>  <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Yes, there are many "help-lines," open phone lines for people to talk anonymously about many topics, some specifically targeting: children, teens; depression; alcoholism and much more.
