I walked over to the Supersol on Agron, near King George Street. This is not an easy task today as the construction of the inner city (Jerusalem) train/trolley system is going on full steam, and evening and night are the peak periods of work. There were many stumbling blocks − literally − in the path, as well as fences and equipment and, of course, the ever-present traffic.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">_option_option

In the book she describes her <span style="font-style: italic">Tateh</span> as being an Orthodox rabbi named Fishel Shilsky. Twice widowed, she brought up all 12 of her children, mostly in poverty, but always in deep faith, never even applying for welfare funding. All of her children went on to graduate from university and some of them have post-graduate degrees. Mr. McBride, a musician, reporter and college professor, was always troubled by questions regarding his identity. In this book, he finally persuades his mother to tell her story. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Ruth says, in an interview with her now adult son, that her father was as "hard as a rock." Her sweet-tempered mother, Hudis Shilsky, or <span style="font-style: italic">Mameh</span> to Ruth, wed Tateh in an arranged marriage. The story goes on to recount how her Mameh never felt love or affection from Tateh. Mameh was mild and meek, partly from having had polio, the effects of which she suffered her entire life. The family had migrated to America and finally settled in rural Virginia in a black community where they ran a grocery store. The black community, according to an amazon.com review, was more accepting of Jews (well, at least less violent towards them, than the local white one!). </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">When Mameh died, she left her home and her father, who she described as being "inappropriate" and abusive. She eventually married an African-American man (McBride's biological father). At one point during her hard life, she describes going to visit her mother's sister for help; she was turned away as an embarrassment to the family. She was widowed and later married another African-American man, Hunter Jordan. He raised the eight McBride children as his own and then the four children they had together. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Growing up in Harlem and other all black neighborhoods James McBride and his 11 siblings were always troubled, due to the fact that their mother was white. He feared for her safety and had many unanswered questions regarding her identity as well as his own. She was a very religious</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-family: 'Times New Roman'"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">woman who began her own Baptist church in her home, when her children would ask: "What color is G-d?" she would answer: "The color of water."</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">As I began to make sense of the association (water and the florist stand I had passed), I also thought about the recent headline news story here regarding "events" in a religious elementary school for girls</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Yediot Ahronot reported that four Ethiopian first grade girls who had just moved from Haifa to Petah Tikva, enrolled in a Zionist Haredi elementary school called Lamerchav. Once in this school, they were "segregated" into a classroom at the end of the hall, had a separate teacher, and had no contact with other students their age. Their recess periods were also at different times than the other children, and they were transported by taxi and not on the regular school bus. "As far as Principal Yishayahu Granwich was concerned, however, these new students could not be fully integrated into the school community. Ostensibly − as noted by municipality officials − this was because the girls were not observant enough, and did not belong to the Religious Zionist Movement as do all of the students at the school.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-family: 'Times New Roman'"> </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"School officials" also note that since the school only agreed to admit these Ethiopian students at the municipality's insistence, they therefore were forced to relegate them to special classrooms where they could "catch up academically." Furthermore, the students in question also attended many lessons in regular classrooms along with their peers. The school staunchly denies the claims that the girls had separate recess hours, labeling the claim as "utterly false." Furthermore, school officials describe the cab rides home as a "perk" given to the Ethiopian students by the local municipality. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"Who wouldn't want to be chauffeured home in a cab?" they remarked, according to <span style="text-decoration: underline">ynetnews.com</span>. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Had this been an isolated incident of elitism and "separate and un-equal," one might have been able to explain it away. However, it is not a secret that many Haredi schools will not accept Ethiopian immigrants, though they do accept immigrants (read "white") from other countries whose families are not so observant and even include converts. Other seminaries and <span style="font-style: italic">yeshivot</span> do not accept <span style="font-style: italic">frum</span> Israeli children from "eastern" (read "Sephardic") backgrounds</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-style: italic; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">On this basis, Moshe Rabbeinu's children would not have been permitted to attend these schools. His wife was "of color" and she and his father-in-law Yithro (Jethro) were converts! Yithro is credited with helping Moshe promulgate the Torah by teaching first tens, then having those tens teach others and so on, and so forth.
