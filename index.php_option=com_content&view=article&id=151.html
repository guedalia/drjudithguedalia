We present these to anxious people sitting outside these critical care units.

One can't give a loan if one has no "money" in the <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Bank HaNafshi</span> (Emotional Bank). Chaim K. has difficult days and nights thinking about life in general, and his future, in specific. It is so hard seeing his classmates and siblings moving ahead in life, or just plain <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">moving </span>on their own. </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>"When I see the world going by, I think of myself as 'a goldfish in a bowl,' staring at the world, imprisoned in a fixed space, without even the privacy to cry. I don't even have the ability to hide myself under the covers and be alone; I have to ask someone to do that for me." </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>I nod in agreement, and add that the goldfish can cry "privately" as he is in water, which camouflages his tears. Chaim smiles and winks at me, as if to say: "That's a good point". Then he continues: "I do feel good though when we go to the hospital and hand out the bags. Even in this wheelchair with the respirator 'breathing,' people say they get strength from me."</span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>I am reminded of the book, <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">The Giving Tree</span> by Shel Silverstein. "Once there was a tree...and she loved a little boy." Every day the boy would come to the tree to eat her apples, swing from her branches, or slide down her trunk...and the tree was happy. But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave. </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>First, the tree is a place for the boy to play and munch on apples, later its branches serve as a source of lumber to build a house, and later still, its trunk provides the wood for a boat. By the time the boy has become an old man, he has used so much of what the tree has to give, that all that remains is a stump. Yet, all that the old man needs at this point, is a place to sit and rest - a function the solitary stump can still provide. The story ends with a sad: "and the tree was happy." (From the Online Editors of Barnes & Noble.) I never liked this story, even though millions of readers love it. </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>We are told that a person who gives <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">tzedakah</span> should give only a percentage (10 percent) of his money. Moreover, someone who gives more than that amount (over 20 percent) is considered a <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">rasha</span> (evil person) but, what about the recipient of acts of kindness? In a recent week's <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Haftara</span>, Elisha asks the woman who prepared a special room for him when he made his annual sojourn in that part of the country, what he could do for her, as a sign of his gratitude. </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>In the Torah reading preceding the Ten Plagues, Rashi notes that Moshe <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Rabbainu</span> did not execute the first three Plagues, because of his "relationship" with the Nile, the <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Yaor</span>, in which his mother placed him in a basket, and thus was saved by the river. </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>"The Giving Tree" story always afforded me an opportunity to teach, to whomever I was reading the story, how <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">Hashem</span> wants us to give <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">tzedakah</span> (charity), but that, equally as important - how central <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">hakarat hatov</span> (acknowledgment of munificence) - is to the process. In this story the boy <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">took </span>throughout his life and the "tree" never taught him responsibilities or boundaries of taking. In the end, the boy, now an old man, came to <span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic">take</span> again. The "tree" was finally nothing but a stump, so the old man sat down on it. The book ends with: "The tree was happy"; but one who looks at the picture of the old man, can see that he wasn't happy. He is alone, in his taking. He has reduced goodness and charity from the world, by taking from a tree and never planting anything in return. </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-weight: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">         </span>In Chaim K.'s daily schedule he is very dependent on others, but in his actions and words, he gives so much.
