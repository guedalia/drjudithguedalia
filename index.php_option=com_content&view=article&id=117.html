It is described as <span style="color: black">Nocturnal Only; Diurnal Only; and Nocturnal and Diurnal.</span></p> <p><span>            </span>(For more information, visit <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.networktherapy.com/" target="_blank">www.networktherapy.com</a></span>.)</p> <p><span> </span><span>           </span><span>Over the years I have seen many different children with Encopresis, and many more with Enuresis. Examples: Those who left a "gift" at home for someone to find; those that were constipated for a period of time and then "smeared"; and those that "leaked" during the day at home or at school. What amazes me still is how long it takes the parents, and truly the child, to get help.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>One case in particular comes to mind. The father came first by himself. "You don't have to see my wife to understand the problem," he said. The child would "retain" for weeks, and have stomach cramps. They would give him stool softeners, and he would finally be convinced to go to the toilet. Once there, he pressured his parents to "empty" the room, i.e. take out the towels, soap, toothbrushes and anything else around. Then he would close the door to the toilet. Upon reentering they would find feces smeared all over the toilet bowl, bathtub and other surfaces.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>"How long has this been going on?" I asked, assuming the answer to be days or weeks. "Six or seven months," said the father. Astounding, I thought, and how sad that this poor child and his parents have had to suffer for such a long time.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>Generally speaking, in my experience with psychological intervention, the "symptom" should be gone within a month or so. After the first month, accidents may happen over the next three months. Once the "cause/underlying issue" is resolved, the behavior/symptom does not persist.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>Back to the case at hand:<span>  </span></span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>At the appointed time, I invited Sara and Moses Banai and their 12-year-old son Zvi (not their real names) into my office. They came in and all three moved their chairs so that they each sat at some distance from one another. Uhmm, I mused to myself, three islands near each other; is that an archipelago? But it might be a sign of communication difficulties between</span> the family members.</p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>I asked Zvi why he came. He put his hands to his ears to block out sounds and said in a quiet voice, "Ask them." I had a lot of information already, so I asked Zvi if he would mind sitting in the waiting room while I spoke with his parents. A huge smile appeared on his face, he held his hand out wordlessly toward his father who placed a seriously "gagetized" cell phone in his son's outstretched hand, and he was out of the room.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>His parents then began telling their story, which ran the gamut from embarrassment, shame and blame, to anger, tears and frustration - and other emotions in between. They began speaking at the same time and either echoed or disapproved of the others' remarks.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>"Okay, it's my turn to talk now," I said. "I understand this part of the family story. Can you each tell me a bit about your families of origin?" I asked Moses to tell me about his wife's. That was a surprise. He began slowly, measuring his words so as not to wound with his usually verbal, explosive manner of speaking. Sara voicelessly looked at her husband with appreciative eyes, as if to thank him for not saying everything there was to say and for saying what he did with kindness.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>I turned to Sara and said, "Your turn to tell me about Moses's side." As she spoke, he sat wordlessly. She spoke softly and no longer in the shrill tones I had heard when she was describing what went on at home. She was especially supportive of her husband when she described how hard his childhood was, and how hard it must have been (and still is today) for him to live in close proximity to his intransigent and overly strict parents.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>Then I asked them to call Zvi on the cell phone, and ask him to come in.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>I thanked him for letting me have this time with his parents and for being so patient. He seemingly ignored me and brashly told his father that he wants the same cell phone. "It's not fair that you have such a good one and I have a rotten piece of 'junk' " (<span style="font-style: italic">expression modified</span>).</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>His parents looked at each other and at me, shocked and embarrassed. I smiled and thought, now we're cooking with gas. Instead I said, "Almost everything is negotiable. But you just have to learn how to ask, and especially how to speak with respect to the people from whom you want a favor."</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>"What did you talk about for such a long time?" he asked. I answered that we talked about his parents growing up, his grandparents, and things that are going on at home that are difficult for them all.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>"Tell <span style="font-style: italic">him</span> to speak to me with respect first; tell <span style="font-style: italic">him</span> not to hit me; tell <span style="font-style: italic">him</span> not to scream; tell <span style="font-style: italic">her</span> not to cry and tell on me." Then he started to cry.</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>I said that our time is up, but one very important thing came out of this meeting. I said, "Zvi, whatever you do until our next appointment in three days, do not stop 'leaking' - please don't stop."</span></p> <p style="text-indent: 0.5in"><span>I got up from my chair. An hour and a half had gone by, and my next patient would be arriving any moment. Three people rose from their chairs in utter surprise. Numbly confirming the time and date three days hence, they left the room.</span></p><p> <span><span>                                                 </span>(To be continued)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Originally published in the Jewish Press on  August 6, 2008.</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="tags">Tags: <a href="index.php%3Foption=com_search&amp;searchword=Constipation&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Constipation</a> | <a href="index.php%3Foption=com_search&amp;searchword=Elimination+Disorder&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Elimination Disorders</a> | <a href="index.php%3Foption=com_search&amp;searchword=Encopretic&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Encopretic</a> | <a href="index.php%3Foption=com_search&amp;searchword=Enuresis&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Enuresis</a> | <a href="index.php%3Foption=com_search&amp;searchword=Jewish+Press&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Jewish Press</a> | <a href="index.php%3Foption=com_search&amp;searchword=Overflow+Incontinenc&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Overflow Incontinence</a></p></td>
