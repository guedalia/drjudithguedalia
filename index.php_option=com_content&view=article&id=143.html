<p><strong> By Dr. Judith Guedalia, Chaim K., Jenny S. and Mimi N.  © 2007</strong></p><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">         I was nervous. This was going to be my first "group" in a very long time. How would I segue to a foursome from a "<span style="font-style: italic">sicha b'arba eynaim" -</span> literally four-eyed conversation − the vernacular for the French <span style="font-style: italic">tête-à-tête, </span>"head to head" − or in English: a private conversation between two persons?</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">_option_option_option_option_option

 </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Group therapy is different from individual therapy in a number of ways, with the most obvious difference being the number of people in the room with the psychologist. Originally, group therapy was used as a cost-saving measure, in institutional settings where many people needed psychological treatment and there were too few psychologists to provide the treatment. However, in conducting research on the effectiveness of therapy groups, psychologists discovered that the group experience benefited people in many ways that were not always addressed in individual psychotherapy. Likewise, it was also discovered that some people did not benefit from individual therapy.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>In group therapy, you learn that you are not alone in experiencing psychological adjustment problems, and you can experiment with trying to relate to people differently in a safe environment, with a psychologist present to assist, as needed.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Additionally, group therapy allows you to learn from the experiences of others with similar problems and also allows you to better understand how people very different from yourself view the world and interact with people. Of course, there are many other differences between group therapy and individual psychotherapy. Many people are anxious about participating in group therapy, because they don't want other people (in addition to the psychologist) to know about their problems. Group members are told not to discuss information shared in the group with others, and usually the need for mutual confidentiality preserves the privacy of the information.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Jenny S. is congenitally blind, so she doesn't see blindness a major problem requiring the help of a psychologist or anybody else, for that matter. However, today, she has a "dizziness" that has defied medical diagnosis, but which has made her almost totally bedridden.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Mimi N. has a cervical Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). She and I "met" about two hours after the injury. The accident was result of a five-minute motorcycle spin around the block, late in the evening of Yom HaAtzmaut a year and seven months ago.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Chaim K. has a SCI too; he was hit by a car in the early hours of the morning five years ago. I knew all three of them individually, but this was going to be the first time they met each other, and that we would be creating a "new entity": The Group. How would I begin? How would they get along together and with me − now a "facilitator/member" of The Group?</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>The Group was Jenny's idea. There seemed to be no young adult group of this <span style="font-style: italic">sort</span>. What <span style="font-style: italic">sort</span>, you might ask? I guess it kind of defies definition, and since we, The Group, agreed to write a piece, together, I'll let them talk for themselves.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Oops, before they begin, let me describe "The First Meeting." I knew that they had all met psychologists before and were none too enthralled. So, with the help of my son, I downloaded some <span style="font-style: italic">Ke­tzarim</span> − short video clips - of a four-person comedy team that does skits, poking fun at many different subjects. Psychologists are one of their favorites. I chose one clip about the first session of group therapy for people with "imaginary friends." Every one in OUR group is fluent in both languages, and Jenny does a fine job "seeing" with her ears, i.e. listening to the nuances in the video. As I had hoped, they all thought the video clip was funny, and it gave us a chance to "size" each other up.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"Without further ado, let's introduce ourselves." This went without a hitch. Then I asked each one to say how someone who didn't know them would describe them. Jenny said they would say she is blind. For Chaim, this was the first time in his life − well, in the five years since he has been a quadriplegic − that his condition was not obvious to someone he had just met. He said he is in a wheelchair; so too said Mimi.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"Okay," I said, "now, how would I, Judi, introduce you?"</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"Oh," said Jenny, "Judi would say I was smart, witty and I'm not using all my intelligence and blah-blah-blah." Chaim started to laugh. "What's so funny?" I asked. "She would say the same thing about me," Chaim answered. Mimi smiled too. That was our first meeting.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>By now we are on our fifth and The Group is somewhat more familiar with the extent of each other's medical situation, which they each had just "mildly" alluded to and "significantly" minimized that first meeting.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>At some point, Chaim's articles with me were discussed, along with the fact that he receives mail (e-mail and snail-mail), proving "that <span style="font-style: italic">even</span> someone as handicapped as I am, can have an effect on others." He also told about going to give out candies and cakes to families waiting outside of critical care units. Mimi was very impressed with this gesture.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>In most situations, with five years "under his belt" so to speak, Chaim is an "experienced" handicapped person. Well, sort of, until he met Jenny, someone who is congenitally blind but only considers herself handicapped for a year and a half, since her dizziness began. Mimi's "entry" into this world is relatively new. All three though, have developed a sixth sense in relation to assessing the people with whom they come into contact.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>So they decided to work on a topic for me to write up. How do they size up the people they meet for the first time?</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Jenny says she pays attention to the content of the language the person uses. Examples, she gives of the difference are: <span style="font-style: italic">passive</span> voice: "It will be taken care of," rather than the <span style="font-style: italic">active</span> voice: "I will take care of it." Jenny feels that people who use this grammatical formulation are controlling and patronizing, two <span style="font-style: italic">really </span>nasty words in Jenny's lexicon. "Being blind makes people feel that they can tell you what to do: 'cross here,' 'let me take your hand,' and many such intrusions," she says with feeling. "Can you imagine that <span style="font-style: italic">not only once,</span> have people shouted at me, thinking that blind means deaf?"</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Chaim and Mimi burst out laughing and so does Jenny. They have personal experience with people who are "trying-to-help" but end up hurting them, instead.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Chaim has developed a series of <span style="font-style: italic">questions</span> he asks others and waits to see their reactions, both verbal and non-verbal. He is a very keen observer and his questions have become laser sharp and more indirect, as time goes on. So, in a relatively short period of time he can zero in on his quarry without them even being aware of the <span style="font-style: italic">meta</span>-conversation that is going on with this smiling person in a wheelchair.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Mimi is speaking for herself: "I pay attention to what the person is looking at. I used to think that someone checking me out was flattering, but now it's become something intrusive. I wonder if people are listening to <span style="font-style: italic">me</span> or are trying to figure out 'how she works,' as if I am some odd object, not a person like they are.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"I often feel like they are zooming in on my hands; I am unable to move my fingers, and they are permanently in a bent, contracted position.
