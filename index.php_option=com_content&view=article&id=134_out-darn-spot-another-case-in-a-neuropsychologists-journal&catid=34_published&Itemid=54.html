Consequently the nightmares they develop of being "entombed" in an elevator could be seen as part of the "process" of empathizing with the person who died. This perspective of her difficulties was helpful for a while, she reported, but the feelings of choking and gasping for air soon returned to what they had been prior to therapy.</span> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"How do you think I might be able to help you?"</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"I was just at the pulmonologist for my belabored breathing and he suggested I speak to you as my lungs are as clear-as-a-whistle," she smiled ironically, all the while breathing with great gasps.

He wasn't very sure you could help me. He says that, though you are a senior-level psychologist, you don't follow the accepted ways of doing things." (My ears perked up, because, for the first time in the conversation, I detected a respectful tone in this "<span style="font-style: italic">wannabe</span>" patient.) </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"Also," she went on, "my grandson helped me 'Google' you and I really do think that the psychiatrist is wrong and you might be the very person to help me.

Sometimes I do. But I can never leave the building alone," said this fashionably dressed and well-coiffed septuagenarian. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>This said, she sat back and waited to see if I would pick up the gauntlet. She gave the impression that not only was she an intelligent woman but one that could see the ironies of life and especially the peccadilloes (a slight fault) of others. I assumed that was the case, considering that I do like to be intellectually stimulated by a challenge. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>As she was relaying her story, I kept asking myself what is the Neuropsychology here? What is the Brain/Behavior Relationship? What type of "standard" neuropsychological assessment might "unleash" the answers to her behavioral/medical responses? Her responses to elevators seemed to relate more to be post-traumatic stress reactions than standard, unresolved mourning, or survivor guilt - though life has taught me that there is no "standard/normal" only many single cases!</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>I asked her if she would bear with me and walk to the elevator bank further down the hallway from the Neuropsychology Unit, which is on the fifth floor at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. She gave me a long, hard stare, and smiled and said: "Dr. X was right, you don't do anything anyone else does! OK, let's go." </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>As we walked to the elevator she was breathing loudly, all the while, answering my questions about her visit to Israel. I told her that we would wait for an empty elevator, and that I would press the stop button at any point she felt she couldn't breath, and that we would only go down one floor. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>When the elevator arrived, she looked at me and grasped her neck with her hand, much like choking herself and, in a very small voice, said: "I can't do it, I can't even go in." I said "Fine," and we walked back to my office. I did notice, though, that she had finger marks on her neck. When we got back she took out her compact from her bag, and as she was re-fixing her face, she looked at her neck and said: "See, here are the marks again." She obviously had not recalled that she had squeezed her neck herself. "<span style="font-style: italic">Hmmm</span>, this sounded very promising," I thought to myself.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Our time was up and we made another appointment for two days hence. I said I'd like her to pay attention to any daydreams, night dreams or nightmares she may have and jot them down till we would meet again.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>She came to our appointment on time, again looking very well dressed in a coordinating outfit of dress, shoes, hat, and handbag. She was also carrying a small notebook.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>She smiled, and proudly said: "I did my homework, I wrote down all my dreams, day and night, and though I am somewhat scared, I am also very excited about this meeting." </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Once I explained EMDR* and set up a "Safe Place" for her to imagine when any thoughts that came up might be difficult. I asked her to choose one of the dreams from the notebook as a focus of what would be our first EMDR session.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>She described an image of being in an elevator going to a wedding hall. There were other people in the elevator and it was a little crowded. She felt that she was being "pushed" into a corner. She began to breathe in a labored fashion. I continued to do the bilateral movements. All of a sudden, she stopped and said that something very odd happened. The elevator changed into her bedroom in her old house and the man next to her changed into her ex-husband.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"Go with that" (pretty standard EMDR statement when things look like a break-though is about to happen).</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>"I am upstairs, in the laundry room, I feel I am being pushed against the wall"</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Silence, then I whispered: "Go with that."</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial"><span>       </span></span><span style="font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">She continues: " and all of a sudden, I see my ex-husband with his hands around my throat.
