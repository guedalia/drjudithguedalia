Getting very little, or no significant amounts of rain, is a real threat to agriculture which all of us here take very personally, even if Hi-Tech is on the way of supplanting (sorry for the pun) agriculture, it is our financially successful export industry.</span>   <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">_option_option_option

(A smudge pot - also known as a '</span><span style="font-style: italic">choofa</span><span>" in Australia - or orchard heater - is an oil-burning device used to prevent frost forming on fruit trees. Usually a smudge pot has a large round base with a chimney coming out of the middle of the base.

The person who came for assistance was blind. She was hearing cacophonic music all the time and it affected her ability to function, to such an extent that she stayed in bed all day long.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">I told her that ,though she may be blind, I am well-neigh "music disabled". I enjoy music but really cannot hum a tune on key. As she began to help me understand the sounds she described, I found myself running down a mental list of diagnoses such as: auditory hallucinations usually a sign of psychiatric (psychosis?), neurological (e.g. epilepsy?) or middle ear (Tinnitus?) problems.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">"Before you ask, I was already at a neurologist and ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist", she explained.

"Please continue to describe it the best you can, because - as I said - I am 'music impaired'."</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">I asked questions about the "music" and interspersed questions about her "history".

I didn't share this with her at the time, but I have clinically seen (and research into PTSD- Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has proven) that once one gives words to "sensed" feelings, their effect on the emotional/visceral self can be better mediated in therapy or by the individual themselves.</span></p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">She returned and she said: "a funny thing happened as I wrote the words to the 'dirge' I heard.
