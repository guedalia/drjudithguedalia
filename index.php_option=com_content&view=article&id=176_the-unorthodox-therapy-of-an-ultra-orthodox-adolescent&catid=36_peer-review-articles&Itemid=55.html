In this particular therapy, the therapeutic relationship was emphasized.

An important part of his ther</span>apy, therefore, was to acquire more functional learning methods. At the beginning of the therapy, it was immediately clear that Yisrael was ignorant of—and <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">curious about—human anatomy in general and sexual</span> matters in particular.

The idea is to give the patient a more active role in the therapy, thereby cementing and developing what is accomplished during the therapy sessions. In this case, the therapist took something over which Yisrael felt he had no <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt">control—masturbation—and attempted to</span> give him a certain amount of control. Paradoxically, his assignment was to masturbate. Five times per day, three days per week, he <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">had to masturbate, immersing himself in the</span> ritual bath (<em>miqve</em>) each day that he masturbated (the <em>miqve</em> is prescribed by Hasidic custom for anyone who ejaculates sperm). His actions—which, until now, he could not control—were raised to a voluntary and controllable level.

The realization that he was in control of his actions increased <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">his self-respect; he no longer saw himself at the mercy</span> of mysterious, uncontrollable urges.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.2pt; line-height: 13pt" class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'; letter-spacing: -0.2pt">Yisrael was given a second “homework assignment.”</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'"> He would occasionally travel by bus to visit relatives <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt">in an ultra-Orthodox enclave about an hour away.</span> Because of security considerations in Israel, the pas<span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt">senger seated in the front seat of the bus must be</span> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt">physically able to help the bus driver in case of a</span> <span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt">terrorist attack (much like the airplane passenger</span> seated by the emergency exit).

While the therapist must create a warm atmosphere, he or she must also be focused and fairly strict about the treatment. This particular therapy’s structure was consistently maintained. Each session opened the same way. Yisrael would report how often he had masturbated, how he felt about it, and whether he felt he was developing more control. The discussion would take its own course from there, but even if only briefly, each session began the same way. </span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.2pt; line-height: 13pt; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'; letter-spacing: -0.1pt">Ross’s model uses the method of Socratic questioning,</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'"> which leads the patient to independently identify his own feelings rather than passively be diagnosed by the therapist. Since this method of questioning is used in the Talmud, it was familiar to Yisrael and he was able to internalize it to help identify his problems even though the therapy process itself was completely foreign to him. A bridge was built between the two worlds, and his ability to relate the two helped in the progression of the therapy.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.2pt; line-height: 13pt; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'; letter-spacing: -0.1pt">Socratic questioning succeeded in taking Yisrael on a cognitive journey starting in his own community and reaching the new and different world of the therapist’s </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'; letter-spacing: -0.2pt">office.

During the first appoint<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">ment, when Yisrael told the therapist that he engaged</span> in homosexual acts, she was very clear with him about the unacceptability of his conduct.

He mentioned frequenting a public park where male and female prostitutes gather and where unprotected sex takes place. Again, the therapist made it very clear that she would terminate the therapy if he continued going to this park. “I don’t <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">want to work with a dead person,” she stated, because</span> of his risk of contracting AIDS through unprotected sex.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.2pt; line-height: 13pt; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'; letter-spacing: -0.1pt">The therapist came to symbolize openness because</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'"> <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">she acted as a window to the outside world.

This was further reinforced by the homework assignments discussed earlier. Additionally, continuing to attend yeshiva and to board there once a week allowed him to test and verify his new perceptions in the “real” world.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.2pt; line-height: 13pt; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'; letter-spacing: 0.1pt">For someone from a community where innova</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'">tions are frowned upon and suspected, where openness about feelings and opinions is not the norm, the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt">therapeutic experience had the potential to be frighten</span>ingly unsettling.

When Yisrael asked the therapist whether she would mind if he ate them during the session, she said that she felt that they had their place, but that they mostly create more mess than food. They may look big, but there is little nourishing <span style="letter-spacing: 0.1pt">value in them. While it may be acceptable to eat</span> them, it is important to put the mess in its place.

This partnership is what allowed for resolution of Yisrael’s issues and his return to a predominantly male world. </span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.2pt; line-height: 13pt; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'; letter-spacing: -0.1pt">The therapy sessions were to end at the conclusion</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Dutch801 Rm BT'"> of the yeshiva academic year, roughly corresponding <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">to the month of July. As July approached, the sessions</span> <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt">took on a different tone. Yisrael began bringing stories</span> of the late Rebbe’s acts of piety and also related lessons he had learned in his Talmud studies. At the therapist’s request, the yeshiva increased the number of times he was allowed board, from once a week to twice. This was a tangible effect of his newfound faith in himself and proof of the yeshiva’s faith in him.
