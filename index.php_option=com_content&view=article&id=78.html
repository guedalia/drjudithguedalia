<p dir="ltr" align="left">If you happen to be in Israel after January 1<sup>st</sup>, you will see many cars with reflective vests hanging over front row seats otherwise they might be in the glove-compartment.  The date has been designated for a new traffic ‘law', punishable by fine and ‘points' for a ‘moving traffic violation' (the most serious of traffic violations).</p>_option_option_option

<p dir="ltr" align="left">In their wisdom, the Ministry of Transportation decided that a way to deal with traffic accidents, injuries and death on the roads is to require every driver to have a reflective vest, to be used when s/he alights from their car on a highway or road.  The law applies to all vehicles in Israel, including private cars, commercial vehicles, motorcycles and quad bikes.  Sharon Kedmi of Haaretz newspaper wrote that the Transportation Ministry says that the obligation to wear the vest is intended to increase the driver's visibility during the day and at night, while making repairs or getting help. Drivers who do not wear a reflective vest upon exiting their vehicles will have the option of facing trial or paying a fine instead, the ministry said. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Jason Silberman of the Jerusalem Post, quotes Professor Elihu Richter, head of the Unit of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, a division of the Hebrew University- Hadassah School of Public Health and Community Medicine, and a frequent critic of the Transportation Ministry, who said that he agreed with the new law, but that further laws must be made to further insure safety. </p><p dir="ltr" align="left">And therein lays my query. In the year 2003-2004 over 18,266 people were injured in vehicular accidents, over 52,614 were counted as ‘involved persons'.  The great majority were NOT injured getting out of their cars on the highway.  No, they were killed, injured and maimed by people driving in other cars.   So who benefits the most from the law requiring reflective vests when going out of a car on the highway?</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">Well I don't know about your country (be it the Americas or Europe The Jewish Press is widely read), but here in Israel it seems to be perfectly acceptable to ‘answer-the-call-of-nature' by getting out of your car (or a bus for that matter, they have to stop if someone says the have ‘to go'), be you on a highway or other intercity road. I understand (maybe it's an urban myth) that when Mayor Blomberg of New York was told that New York City needs more public toilets, he said: "Why, there are Starbucks (the coffee shops) on almost every corner!"</p><p dir="ltr" align="left">I shudder to think what kind of ‘ticket or fine' someone would get stopping on the side of a road in the States, when nature ‘called'.  Here it's just fine, if you are wearing a reflective vest!</p><p class="tags">Tags: <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Ministry+of+Transpor&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Ministry of Transportation</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Nature+Called&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Nature Called</a> | <a href="index.php_option=com_search&amp;searchword=Reflective+Vest&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Reflective Vest</a></p></td>
