<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">It was an unusual request for an  appointment. A phone call from a <span style="font-style: italic">Rav</span> who  is a well-known popular <span style="font-style: italic">posek</span> for  married couples, requesting an appointment to come and speak with me about  something personal.</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">Sure, I said, sensing that this  was as unusual a request for him to make, as it was for me to receive.</p> _option_option

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">At the appointed time he arrived  and sensing on the phone how uncomfortable he was, as the <span style="font-style: italic">helper</span> <span style="font-style: italic">going  for help</span>, I had prepared a tea/coffee tray as well as an unopened box of  cookies (which he could eschew (or chew) as the <span style="font-style: italic">Hashgacha </span>permitted.)<span>  </span>I felt that this might help to level the  playing field when the mountain, so to speak, traveled to Mohamed.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">Dressed in traditional <span style="font-style: italic">Haredi</span> garb, the Rav sat looking intently at  the wall where, for all intents and purposes, he saw some sort of deflected  image of me in a picture frame glass.<span>   </span>After years of working with the ultra Orthodox community of males, I  understand and respect this for what it is: eye-contact in a permissible  format.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">After we finished the  "coffee-tea thing" he said: "Thank you for seeing me on such short notice, I  know you are very busy."<span>  </span>"We are all  busy", I countered, "and there is a saying that: If you want something done, ask  a busy person, so I guess we're going to get 'something' done."</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">He smiled an inscrutable  smile.<span>  </span>I waited.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">"A person, a married man in his  early forties, came to me with a question.<span>   </span>He knows I work with young couples and help them with <span style="font-style: italic">shalom bayit</span> issues at the beginning of their  marriage." (I have learned over the years that the term <span style="font-style: italic">shalom bayit</span> usually refers to anything but  <span style="font-style: italic">peace in the home</span>!)<span>  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">He went on: "I asked him how I  could help; we spoke of his learning, his family of origin, his children, his  wife, and the stress of worrying about how to make ends meet.<span>  </span>All this was conversation, but I knew he  wasn't getting to the point, getting to the reason he came to see me.<span>  </span>I started to tell him our time was almost up,  whereupon the man began to cry.<span>  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">"I was so taken aback because it  hadn't seemed as if our conversation had touched on anything emotionally  meaningful.<span>  </span>Then he asked me the  question that brought me here, to your office, Dr. Guedalia.<span>  </span>He asked: "Don't I deserve to be happy too,  don't I deserve an opportunity in life to love and be loved?"<span>  </span>He was quietly sobbing, and I didn't know  what to do; this had never happened to me before. </p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">"Certainly, people who have come  to me have cried and showed their emotions, but this was the first time anyone  had posed this particular question to me, and it was the first time I felt  hit-between-the-eyes like this.<span>  </span>I've  thought about his question and what followed for weeks, before making the  appointment to come and talk with you."</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">At this point, I still had still  not been told what the reason for his referral was, but it was clear that the  question the Rav had been asked touched a chord in him that resonated in ways  other <span style="font-style: italic">shealot</span> have not.<span>  </span>I thought that the conversation he relayed  and his reaction might have had more to do with the word <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">deserve</span> than even the word  <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">love</span>.<span>  </span>I'm not sure what made me think so, but he  might have emphasized the word in a way that was different from the other words  in his narrative.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">In life we all have periods  where we feel we are in a certain groove (I guess that vinyl record metaphor  dates me!).<span>  </span>At any rate, there is  routine that is comforting and helps put order in our lives, and yet, sometimes  the thought of breaking-out is a tantalizing one.<span>  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">I remember when we first moved  to Israel there were <span style="font-style: italic">sherut</span> /jitney  stands up and down Jaffa Road, with their drivers shouting out different  destinations, cities and towns all over the country as they attempted to fill  their taxis before they left.<span>  </span>I remember  wondering what it would be like to just say: Ok, I'll go to Kiryat Ono (I'm not  even sure where it is today!) and then reality would hit, and I'd know that I  had a stroller in my hand with some little person with needs and wishes; my  husband would be home for dinner, which needed to be cooked; a <span style="font-style: italic">shiur</span> to attend, planned for the evening,  school work to do etc., etc., etc.<span>  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>I've often thought about a song:  </span><span>"<span style="font-weight: bold">Stop the world I want to get off</span>"</span><span> from the 1960's musical of the same  name by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley.<span>   </span>In the story, the hero felt caught up in an empty lifestyle, and what  turned out to be a success early in his life, that he didn't appreciate. Not  only that; he also felt trapped and wanted "off the carousel".  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>It usually takes less than a  nanno-second of thought and I would think of how fortunate I was to have a  "carousel" at all; a life that G-d gave me with all the responsibilities of  being a Jew and how the feeling of needing − <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">deserving</span> − time-off was  only possible because I had so many things pulling on me and my time, even with  the "freedom" of being required to do positive <span style="font-style: italic">mitzvot,</span> which were time dependent!<span>  </span></span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">These thoughts passed through my  mind as the Rav continued his story.<span>  </span>The  man who came to him was someone who was grappling with sexual desires that were  against <span style="font-style: italic">halacha</span> in its most basic  sense.<span>  </span>The question of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">deserving love</span> was tainted  by that fact.<span>  </span></p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">The Rav clearly had knowledge  and opinions steeped in Halacha and would surely be able to help this religious  man do the right thing.<span>  </span>But he came to  me, someone perceived as a "secular thinking" person (a psychologist) who was  <span style="font-style: italic">frum</span>, could possibly offer a different  perspective.<span>  </span>He asked if I felt −  psychologically speaking − that the terms <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">deserve</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">love</span> could be validated,  though they were contra to what he believed in so strongly?</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">I thought a bit; not too long,  because my "psychological" mind and soul are inexorably intertwined with my frum  self and so, I asked the Rav a question. " What if this troubled person had  asked instead: 'Don't I deserve to live my life with love' − then I waited a  second and said − "with my neighbor's wife?" </p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">"Ahh, I know both the problem  and its solution", said the Rav, with a smile on his lips and a twinkle in his  eye, sagely touching his beard.<span>  </span>"It is I  who has been influenced by the world around me, not you, the 'modern', frum  psychologist".</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">Originally published in the Jewish Press on  July 9, 2008.</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="tags">Tags: <a href="index.php%3Foption=com_search&amp;searchword=Jewish+Press&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Jewish Press</a> | <a href="index.php%3Foption=com_search&amp;searchword=Love&amp;areas[]=jtags.html" >Love</a></p></td>
