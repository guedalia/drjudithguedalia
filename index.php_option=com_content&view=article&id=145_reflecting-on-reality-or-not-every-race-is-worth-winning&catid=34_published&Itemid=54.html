Ramachandran, the neuroscientist who was born in India, educated in England and living and teaching in the United States, turned his attention to Behavioral Neurology. Ramachandran is best known for his work on neurological syndromes such as phantom limbs, specifically his invention of The Mirror Box.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Previous attempts at eliminating the phantom pains involved surgery to remove another inch or two from the affected limb/stump or even cutting through the relevant nerve root emerging from the spinal cord. These methods are very rarely found to be effective and generally end up with a surgical "game- without-end" in a manner described by Ramachandran as "chasing the phantom."</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>He describes in detail, the behavior of phantom limbs that might not necessarily hurt, but will gesture, itch, twitch or even try to pick things up. He also describes that some people's representations of their limbs don't actually match what they should be, for example, one patient reported that her phantom arm was about "six inches too short."</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span><span> </span>In order to alleviate phantom limb pain, Ramachandran developed The Mirror Box, in which patients place their good limb and the amputated limb, and imagine making mirror symmetric movements. Due to the visual feedback, patients feel their limbs to be moving, which helps alleviate phantom limb pain. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that this may be a result of reversing the remapping that leads to phantom limb pain.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Sitting opposite Levi, I had an idea. Maybe I could use a variation of The Mirror Box to help him out. I asked him if he looked like his brother. He replied that he did. I asked if his voice and that of his brother's were similar. Again, he replied that they were. I took a mirror out of my bag and showed it to him. "Does the image in the mirror look like your brother?" I asked, "It does," he answered. </span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>I went on, "We both know how much you want to go home. We also know how much you and your brother look alike and sound alike. Could you now look at the reflection in the mirror and say: 'I have to rush today, because I am late to go to the airport? I am going home today.<span style="letter-spacing: 2pt">'</span>"</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>Levi asked, "Do you want me to say my brother's words in the mirror to me?" "Yes," I said enthusiastically. He did this a few times. It was hard for him to humor me, but he did do it.</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span><span> </span>"You see," I said, "I think that your <span style="font-style: italic">neshamah</span> knows how much you want to go home and so it 'convinced' your brain that your brother's words were your words."</span></div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>At that moment his brother called from the plane to say goodbye. With tears rolling down his face he wished his brother a <span style="font-style: italic">Nesiah Tovah</span> (good journey). He left the office slowly; he was no longer in a rush. My heart ached for him as I thought that frequently, achieving reality isn't a race we wish to win.</span></p> <div class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk">Bibliography:</span></div> <div class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"> </div> <div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: NewCenturySchlbk"><span>         </span>V.S.
